<p><span class="dropcap">P</span>RISCILLA just laughed quietly to herself
and lay perfectly still. Then Susette
called again, but now you could
tell from the sound that she had taken
Grace and Halbert and gone further into
the woods. Probably she had decided that
Priscilla had run on ahead and would be
waiting for them at the shaky little bridge
or the old red saw mill. What a scare
Susette would have when she reached the
old mill and Priscilla wasn’t there? And
what business had Susette to make such
an awful fuss just because a person chose
to eat quite a good deal of cake, and a
pickle, and a rather large plate of ice cream
at the same meal? They wouldn’t hurt Susette,
anyway.</p>

<p>Then once more the little girl heard her
nurse calling her, and the voice came from
such a long way off that somehow the
sound made Priscilla feel just the least bit
lonely. In about a minute and a half she
would get up and follow the others. She
would hide, though, and watch Susette clap
her hands to her ears, and hear her give
one of those jumpy little French screams
when she came to the mill and there was
no one there. No one could be quite so
funny as Susette when she was really and
truly frightened.</p>

<p>Priscilla was still smiling at the way the
prim little nurse was sure to behave when
she caught sight of something that made
Susette, and the children, and the bridge,
and the old mill, all fly out of her head just
the way she had seen a flock of English
sparrows dart out of the front lawn when
Rover pounced down upon them from the
terrace. It was only a big yellow and black
bumble-bee, but who in this world ever saw
a bumble-bee act like&mdash;well, the best way
is just to go ahead and tell what it really
did.</p>

<p>Almost the very first thing, and before
Priscilla had time to even think whether
she liked him or not, he put his little front
foot up to his pert little countenance and
wiggled his saucy little fingers at her, in a
most objectionable manner. It was exactly
for all the world like what the butcher’s boy
did when Priscilla offered him a cream
chocolate on the first day of April. At
least, that’s the way it looked to Priscilla,
but, between you and me, I rather suspect
the bumble-bee was just wiping off the
pollen that had stuck to his lips ever since
dinner time. He hadn’t any napkin, you
know, so what else could he do?</p>

<p>However, that wasn’t any excuse at all
for what he did next. Remember, Priscilla
had her eyes on him all the time, so
there couldn’t be any mistake about it.
The bumble-bee just simply reached up and
raised his&mdash;yes, it was really&mdash;a dainty little
three-cornered hat&mdash;just like the one in
the picture of her great-great ancestor in
the dining-room. Then he bowed, and he
did it every bit as politely as Mr. Alwin,
the minister, when he came up the front
steps Sunday afternoon. Did you ever
hear of anything like it? At first Priscilla
thought she must have fallen asleep, so she
sat bolt upright and rubbed her eyes. The
moment she moved the bumble-bee again
took off his hat, but for the life of her Priscilla
couldn’t tell what he did with it. Once
it seemed as if he must have slipped it under
his left wing, but it’s quite as likely that he
swallowed it. At any rate, there he sat
with his head cocked to one side, and
his little black bead of an eye twinkling impertinently,
as if he had just asked, “Did
you speak, ma’am?” It was very provoking.</p>

<p>Now, I wonder whether any little girl
who reads this would have been wise
enough to do what Priscilla did next? She
saw now that at the very instant&mdash;really, at
the beginning of the instant&mdash;she began to
move, the bumble-bee would stop doing all
these remarkable things. So she just lay
quietly back in the deep, soft grass and half
closed her eyes&mdash;or, perhaps, it was three-quarters&mdash;and
must have looked exactly as
though she were asleep. Then some things
happened in that big oak tree which I’m
sure never, never would have happened if
the bumble-bee had known that, really,
Priscilla was perfectly wide awake.</p>

<p>Indeed, his conduct was so very singular
that Priscilla almost stopped being surprised.
You couldn’t blame her, though,
for giving a little start when she saw that he
had changed his color from yellow to all
black, and that, instead of buzzing about
her, he was running along the limb of the
tree on all his six legs, just exactly like&mdash;Why,
really, he’d changed into a big black
spider. To tell the truth, just at this point
Priscilla was so astonished again that she
couldn’t so much as move an eyelid.</p>

<p>The spider came running along the limb
of the big oak until he was straight above
Priscilla’s head. Then he stopped suddenly
and began to fumble in some sort of
a back pocket in his black velvet coat. The
next moment a delicate silken thread came
dangling down, down, down, and, before
she fairly understood what was happening,
Priscilla felt it tickling her very puggish little
nose. Of course she was indignant, and
raised her hand and brushed the ugly thing
away. Only&mdash;the thread stuck to her fingers,
and when she tried to wipe it off with
her other hand, it stuck to that hand, too.
And the miserable old spider, holding the
thread lightly over one claw and pressing
the other against the side of his puffy black
stomach, was looking down and laughing
fit to shake his eyes out.</p>

<p>But that was only the beginning. Priscilla
was no coward, but you can guess how
she felt when suddenly that old spider sat
up straight and commenced to whirl his
claws around each other like an electric fan,
and the web commenced to roll up, and the
girl began to be drawn right straight up
into the tree. Even a grown person would
have been astonished. And the spider kept
on laughing.</p>

<p>In almost no time she was up in the tree,
and truly she didn’t feel much bigger than
the spider, and yet it didn’t seem to her that
she’d lost much flesh since she left the
ground. It was all very puzzling.</p>

<p>“That’s what I call bringing you up with
a round turn,” said the spider, laughing
immodestly&mdash;or immoderately, Priscilla
wasn’t quite sure which of the words her
mother used in such cases. His jacket was
so tight that it seemed it must burst the very
next giggle.</p>

<p>“Now, to business,” he remarked, suddenly,
tucking his line away in his coat-tail
pocket, and looking severely at Priscilla, as
though it were she, and not himself, who
had been behaving so foolishly.</p>

<p>“The Hopolanthus desires you to call and
explain.”</p>

<p>“The&mdash;the who? I want to go right
straight home.” interrupted Priscilla, with
quite a good deal of shakiness in her voice.</p>

<p>The spider looked surprised, and for a
moment he stood up perfectly erect&mdash;that
is to say, as perfectly erect as is possible
for a person with that kind of a stomach.</p>

<p>“Whenever a little girl lies down in the
shade of the Hopolanthus Tree,” he went
on, sternly, “it means that the Hopolanthus
has business with her, and the only thing
for me to do is to decide upon the route.
I must ask you a question or two. Did you
ever study botany?”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;why, yes&mdash;some,” replied Priscilla,
as soon as she had caught her breath.</p>

<p>“You have, eh! Well, then, how many
cousins had your grandfather’s aunt? Be
a little quick, please.”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;but&mdash;you see&mdash;I guess I&mdash;I
don’t know. Anyway,” she added, indignantly,
as it dawned upon her that she was
being imposed upon, “that hasn’t anything
to do with botany. Not the least mite in
the world.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it has. Yes, it has,” retorted the
old spider, testily.</p>

<p>“It’s the very first thing you ought to
know. It’s about your own family tree.
I’m simply shocked.”</p>

<p>“You’re just dreadful,” exclaimed Priscilla,
angrily, stamping her foot on the
rough bark. “I shall not go a&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I guess you will,” responded
the spider, with a queer little twinkle in his
eyes.</p>

<p>Then, before Priscilla could tell him that
she really and truly wouldn’t move a step,
she felt herself rapidly approaching the
trunk of the tree. It seemed as if the old
oak were suddenly drawing in the limb
upon which she stood, just as a turtle draws
in its long neck. She noticed, too, for the
first time, a hole in the trunk&mdash;a very ordinary
knot-hole, she would have said a
moment before&mdash;which was growing bigger
and bigger as she approached. Unless,
perhaps, she, herself, was shrinking smaller
and smaller. Suddenly, and exactly as if
she did it on purpose&mdash;although she tried
her best not to do it&mdash;Priscilla raised her
two hands over her head and dived right
through the knot-hole, just grazing the tip
of her nose as she went in. Indeed, if her
nose had been the least bit longer, or had
stuck straight out from her face, like some
people’s noses, instead of having its own
neat upward curve, it would have been
badly nipped. Of course, though, Priscilla
had no time just then to think about noses.
Down she went, and around she went, and
very queerly, indeed, she felt.</p>

<p>Now, it isn’t quite easy to count the time
while a person is falling, as I am sure any
friend of yours who has dropped from the
top of a church steeple will tell you if you
ask him. To Priscilla it seemed as if she
had been going just about as long as her
little brother Halbert could sit still at the
dinner table, when&mdash;puff, whist&mdash;and she
had stopped.</p>

<p>“Now, come right along and don’t talk
back. That’s one thing the Hopolanthus
will not stand. You can say anything you
choose if he hasn’t spoken first, but&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But suppose he speaks just as soon as
I come into his parlor?”</p>

<p>“That’s impossible,” responded the spider,
in a very positive tone. “He hasn’t
any parlor; but come along.”</p>

<p>Everything was done in such a dreadful
hurry that Priscilla felt as if she were not
getting more than half as many breaths as
she should.</p>

<p>“Please, Mr. Spider,” she protested, “you
know I’ve come quite a&mdash;a quick distance,
and I want to sit down and rest a few minutes.”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course,” replied the spider. But
the instant Priscilla sat down she found
herself moving along after her guide just
as fast as before. It seemed to her that she
was sliding out through one of the roots of
the big oak tree.</p>

<p>“Here we are. Now be sure you don’t
talk back.”</p>

<p>Slowly it seemed to grow light&mdash;not
bright light, but just so that she could see
where she was. She was in a room, and it
looked a good deal more like a cellar than
a parlor.</p>

<p>At one end of the room sat the Hopolanthus,
and really until he spoke he wasn’t
very terrible. He looked exactly like the
kangaroo Priscilla once saw in the Zoo&mdash;only
after you’d looked at him twice he was
a good deal different.</p>

<p>“What has this&mdash;this young person been
doing, now?”</p>

<p>The way he emphasized that word “now”
made Priscilla forget all about not talking
back. It was just as much as to say that
of course she was always doing something
wrong, and the only question was as to
what she had done last. She opened her
mouth to reply, when she was violently
seized by the arms, and a shrill voice from
just behind answered for her.</p>

<p>“Ah, she eat ze cake&mdash;ze big piece of
cake, and ze big&mdash;ah, ze emense plate of
ze ice cream. It is not wonder she lie here
and keek ze grass, and make ze dreadful
groan. Ze sillee child.”</p>

<p>And Susette shook her again, and Grace
and Halbert danced around and yelled like
a pair of young savages. It was a full
minute before Priscilla could find her voice.</p>

<p>“You had no business to wake me up
just when&mdash;you always do things wrong.
I was just going to tell the old Hopolanthus
that&mdash;”</p>

<p>But the children stopped dancing around,
and Susette stood still and stared&mdash;which
wasn’t common for Susette&mdash;and Priscilla
couldn’t help seeing that they didn’t know
what on earth she was talking about. She
rubbed her eyes and looked up among the
branches of the big oak. There was nothing
there&mdash;neither bumble-bee, nor spider,
nor Hopolanthus&mdash;only a small green
tree toad who winked his dull little eyes
just exactly as if he might, or might not,
know all about it.</p>

    CHAPTER X<br />
    The Landing of the Enemy
    </h3>
</div>

<h4>SYNOPSIS OF PREVIOUS CHAPTERS.</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The story opens in the year of 1777, during one
of the most critical periods of the Revolution.
Hadley Morris, our hero, is in the employ of Jonas
Benson, the host of the Three Oaks, a well-known
inn on the road between Philadelphia and New
York. Like most of his neighbors, Hadley is an
ardent sympathizer with the patriot cause. When,
therefore, a dispatch bearer is captured on the way
to Philadelphia, he gives Hadley the all-important
packet to be forwarded to General Washington.
The boy immediately escapes with it, and, after many
perilous experiences, finally makes his way across
the river to the Pennsylvania side. On the road,
Hadley, failing to give the countersign, is stopped
by a foraging party of Americans; but by his
honest bearing he wins the attention of John Cadwalader,
a personal friend of Washington, just
then journeying to the American headquarters.
Under his protection, our hero speedily arrives at
his destination, and delivers the dispatches. Hadley
then returns to the Three Oaks to resume his duties.
But the lad is destined for a more eventful life.
Shortly afterwards he receives an urgent summons
from Cadwalader, whereupon he immediately sets
out for the patriot headquarters.</p>
</div>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>S Lafe Holdness said, the enemy could
take nothing from the boy courier on
this journey&mdash;nothing of information
or papers of value; but the possibility
of being waylaid and beaten, perhaps
killed, was not pleasant to contemplate.
Hadley could scarcely understand the
veiled warning he had received from Lillian
Knowles. Was her father about to stop
him on the road, believing that he again
carried documents of importance to the
American forces? He did not wish to fall
into Colonel Creston Knowles’ hands just
then, for the latter was angry enough with
him as it was, and Hadley did not care to
add to his irritation.</p>

<p>It might be, however, that somebody else
had overheard a part of the recent conference
in the inn stable, and Lillian was cognizant
of the fact. Some Tory visitor, perhaps,
had known of his starting forth. He
drew rein again in the shadow of a long pile
of cordwood which bordered the wall of the
Benson estate, and felt in the darkness for
a stout club, heavy enough to do a man’s
head serious damage, but not too clumsy
for him to swing easily. Then he chirruped
to Black Molly, and she trotted on, her
master keeping his eyes sharply open for
trouble.</p>

<p>He was too proud to ride back and ask
Lafe to come with him; Hadley did not
lack personal courage. But he was nevertheless
all of a tremor as the little mare
trotted over the hard road. He gripped
the club nervously, and tried to pierce the
gloom, which was thickest, of course, under
the trees which bordered the road. He was
taking the shortest road to the ferry to-night,
for there was no trouble to be apprehended
there from British soldiers, and he
would be sure to get quick transportation to
the other side, for the people at the ferry
were loyal. He would not have gone
around by the Alwood house again for a
good deal.</p>

<p>Rod after rod the inn was left behind and
Black Molly had now brought him quite
a quarter of a mile from the Benson place.
There were no other houses on this road
until he passed the Morris pastures, where
he had his unpleasant meeting with Lon
Alwood the day before. The mare footed
it nicely over the road until now; but suddenly
she threw up her head, her quivering
ears pointed forward&mdash;Had could see them
as dark as the night was&mdash;as though she
listened to some sound too faint for her
rider’s dull hearing to catch.</p>

<p>“What is it, Molly?” the youth demanded,
holding a tight rein and gripping
the club more firmly than before.</p>

<p>Instantly a harsh voice addressed him
out of the darkness. “Stand there, and deliver!”
At the same instant a figure sprang
before the little mare and her bridle was
seized by a firm hand. “Don’t make her
dance!” ordered the stranger; “for if you
do I’ll put a ball through her head and perhaps
one through you.”</p>

<p>Hadley saw that the speaker waved a big
horse-pistol in his other hand, and he spoke
quietingly to Molly. “What do you want?”
he demanded, in as brave a tone as he could
assume.</p>

<p>“Give me what you carry,” commanded
the other, still speaking gruffly. Hadley
felt sure that it was a disguised voice, and
remembering what Lillian Knowles had
said to him as he left the inn, he wondered
who the person was who had halted him.
“No slippery tricks, Had Morris!” growled
he at the horse’s head. “Hand me the papers
you carry. Give me what you’ve got.”</p>

<p>But the strain of disguising his voice
grew too much for the fellow, and as he
talked he unconsciously dropped back into
his usual manner of speaking. At once
Hadley, although he was still unable to see
his face, knew that it was Lon Alwood who
had stopped him. And he was puzzled by
the discovery, for he wondered how Mistress
Lillian could have known of the Tory
youth’s intention.</p>

<p>His mind did not work in one direction
alone, however. Before Alwood had reiterated
his demand Hadley was preparing
to make answer. “You want what I
carry?” he cried. “Then take it!” and
swinging up the club suddenly he brought
it down again upon the shoulder of his
enemy. Lon roared and dropped both the
pistol and the mare’s bridle rein; but Hadley
did not come out of the affray without
trouble.</p>

<p>Black Molly was startled by the blow and
darted to the side of the road. Before the
American youth could pull her in she was
in the ditch, and only her quickness saved
her from a disastrous fall. As she slid down
the steep side of the gulley Had slipped his
feet from the stirrups and leaped to the
ground. Lon, with many imprecations and
threats, groped madly about the dark roadway,
and finally found the pistol. He was
maddened beyond all control now, and
dimly beholding Hadley’s bulk through the
gloom&mdash;where he stood on the edge of the
ditch urging the mare out upon the level
again&mdash;he aimed the weapon and would
have fired at his old schoolfellow point-blank!</p>

<p>But before his finger pressed the trigger
a third actor appeared upon the scene. A
man sprang from the bushes on the far side
of the road and in two strides was beside
the Tory. He seized Alwood’s arm, and
the pistol ball flew wide of its intended
mark.</p>

<p>At the moment the shot was fired Hadley
had managed to half drag Black Molly
from the ditch. His quick side glance saw
the danger, and he sprang for the steed’s
back; the explosion of the heavy pistol
frightened Black Molly again, and before
her rider was firmly settled in the saddle
she was off like the wind. He obtained,
however, another swift glance at the two
figures struggling in the roadway behind
him, just as the second barrel of the weapon
was exploded. The flash lit up the scene,
and with astonishment Hadley recognized
the person who had saved him as Colonel
Knowles’ cockney servant.</p>

<p>He and Molly were a good mile further
on their way, however, before he had time
to think much of this surprising fact, for
the little mare ran like a scared rabbit.
“Who could have sent the man to help
me?” he thought, when Molly had finally
settled into a respectable pace. “Surely
not his master, and Mistress Lillian&mdash;”</p>

<p>To believe that the Colonel’s daughter
had done him this favor&mdash;had sent William
to assist him in overcoming the Tory youth&mdash;was
rather pleasant; yet it seemed too improbable
to be true, and he wondered much
as he rode swiftly on to the ferry.</p>

<p>There was no trouble in crossing the
river on this night. He
found fires burning on
the banks, and the ferrymen
were wide awake.
There was considerable
bustle at the landing, and
Hadley learned that several
parties bound for
Philadelphia had gone
over ahead of him, and
that others were expected.
The loyal Jersey
farmers and farmers’ sons
were hastening to join
General Washington,
eager to take part in this
new movement against
the enemy. The boy was
not delayed or molested
in any way, and once on
the Pennsylvania shore
he urged the little mare
to the utmost, passing
party after party of recruits,
all hastening in
the same direction.</p>

<p>Not long past midnight
he reached the
farmer’s at which he
had previously changed
horses. The man remembered
him, and,
thanks to Hadley’s first
appearance there under
Colonel Cadwalader’s
protection, the youth
was enabled to get a
fresh mount on this occasion.
The farmer, too,
was able to give him certain information
about the movements of the American
forces.</p>

<p>“You will not find his Excellency at Germantown,”
the farmer declared. “Aye, an’
ye’ll not catch him at Philadelphia, I’m
thinkin’. The Redcoats are coming up the
Chesapeake, an’ the army’s movin’ south
to shelter the city from attack.” Then followed
directions relating to crossroads and
bridle paths, by following which he might
overtake the army on its way to Wilmington.</p>

<p>Without waiting for sleep, but fortified
with a hearty meal which the farmer’s wife
prepared, Hadley set off again within the
hour on a fresh mount. He was weary,
saddle-sore, and parched by the August
heat. But he was obeying orders, and although
he did not understand the importance
of the verbal message Holdness had
given him for Colonel Cadwalader, the
youth knew what his duty was. He could
not foresee what was to happen and what
sights he should witness before he again
rode into the yard of the Three Oaks Inn.
The people whom he passed, the Tory element
was not in evidence, were very cheerful
regarding the battle which they believed
would be fought as soon as Lord Howe’s
troops landed. Despair and inaction had
held the Colonials in a hard grip during
these past few months; but now there was
a chance to do something, and the farmers
were again hopeful.</p>

<p>It so happened that while Hadley Morris
was riding hard over the dusty roads
to overtake Washington’s personal staff on
this 24th day of August, the American
army, augmented by fresh recruits, and
some 11,000 strong, marched through the
length of Front street. Philadelphia had
seen some gloomy days of late, but the appearance
of so many armed men was calculated
to raise the spirits of the populace a
little; yet it is said that the cheering along
the line of march lacked that inspiring
quality with which a conquering army usually
goes to battle. It was known that they
were about to meet an enemy well-trained
and seasoned, and, in addition, outnumbering
them by several thousands.</p>

<p>Philadelphia had from the beginning of
the war been the headquarters of rebellion,
and the British were determined to humble
the city. How could Washington’s forces
hope to cope with men who had fought on
half the battle-fields of Europe? It had
been a handful of untrained farmers, however,
who had beaten back the grenadiers
at Bunker Hill; and it could scarcely be
called a trained army that had driven the
Redcoats finally out of Boston town.</p>

<p>It was long past mid-afternoon when
Hadley overtook the rear guard of the
American army. It was no easy matter
to find the commander and his staff, and,
when found, to select Colonel Cadwalader
from the other officers and get near enough
to him to deliver the message he carried.
But the instant the officer saw and recognized
the youth he graciously called him
near. Evidently Lafe Holdness’ message,
which had been a mystery to Had because
he did not understand what the seemingly
simple sentence meant, was most important,
for Colonel Cadwalader hurried off at once
to General Washington, bidding the boy
remain with the column until he returned.</p>

<p>When he did return there was with him
the young officer who had desired Hadley
as a recruit on the day he brought dispatches
to the Commander-in-Chief at Germantown.
“I cannot let you go back just
yet, Master Morris,” Colonel Cadwalader
declared; “I may have work for you to do
later. Meanwhile I shall place you in Captain
Prentice’s care,” and he indicated the
smiling subordinate officer. “You are not
obliged to fight if it be against your conscience;
but you may see some fighting
before you return to Jersey.”</p>

<p>He wheeled his horse and rode away
again, and Captain Prentice offered the
youth his hand. “Leave the nag, Morris,”
he said, cordially, “and take your place with
‘Foot and Leggets’ company. Your horse
seems about done for anyway, and you will
be able to pick up a better one when you
return. You’re to go with me, and I am
in the infantry.”</p>

<p>And so, rather unexpectedly, Hadley
found himself marching with the patriot
forces toward Wilmington. Captain Prentice
secured him a gun, and he shared the
rations of the good-natured fellows about
him. The youth was very tired after his
long ride, but walking was better than riding,
and there were times when the ranks
rested. The next day, however, the army
reached the Delaware town, only to learn
through the scouts that the British had
landed at the head of the Elk River, fifty
miles or more from Philadelphia. The
news spread, too, how greatly the Redcoats
outnumbered the Americans. There were
18,000 of the former, and the faces of even
the rank and file grew grave.</p>

<p>The Americans marched to Red Clay
Creek, beyond Wilmington, and for several
days there were smart skirmishes between
portions of the two armies. But
there was no decisive engagement, and
finally Washington outgeneraled Howe and
fell back upon the Brandywine, which he
crossed at Chadd’s Ford, posting his army
on the hills to the east. Meanwhile Captain
Prentice’s command had seen little
fighting, and both the young officer and
Hadley Morris were anxious to get closer
to the firing line than they had been thus
far.</p>

<p>Hadley had forgotten his original expectation
of returning at once to the Three
Oaks Inn, after having delivered his message
to Colonel Cadwalader; and it looked
as though the Colonel had forgotten him.
But he was so excited by the prospect of a
battle that he was not chafing over the delay
of his return journey. Without doubt
a fight was imminent, the commanders of
the opposing forces maneuvering for the
best positions for their line of battle.</p>

<p>Thus August slipped away, September
came, and the fateful eleventh day approached.</p>

<div class="chapter">
  <h3>CHAPTER XI<br />
  A MESSENGER OF DEFEAT</h3>
  </div>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N the excitement of those September
days, when the two armies overran the
Pennsylvania hills to the west and
south of Philadelphia, Hadley came near
forgetting his Uncle Ephraim and the
promise he had made his mother regarding
the old man. Miser Morris had so repelled
his nephew’s kindly efforts to help him,
that the boy felt he was no more able to
do him any good while at the Three Oaks
than he was miles away from the Morris
farm in the lines of the Continental troops.
And then, the glamour of the life&mdash;the drilling,
the marching, the uncertainty, the danger&mdash;all
fed his imagination and inspired
him with actual delight. Prentice declared
almost hourly that Hadley was “spoiling a
good officer by hanging about a country
inn.”</p>

<p>“I don’t feel that I could regularly enlist,”
the boy said to him, “so I am not
likely to be an officer yet awhile. I am
here only as a volunteer, and my conscience
troubles me, too, at that.”</p>

<p>But all things end in their own good
time, and the long wait which ensued after
the landing of the British finally was closed
on the morning of September 11th. Captain
Prentice’s command had not even
tasted a skirmish until that day; but Hadley&mdash;nor
the captain himself&mdash;could find no
fault with the position they occupied during
the fearful hours which followed the first
gun of attack. Hadley was eager to see a
real battle, to see the armies charge each
other and try their strength upon a real
battle-field, instead of individual men snapping
their muskets at one another in little
skirmishes. Before the end of that day he
could not realize what awful motive had
ever urged such foolish desire in his heart.</p>

<p>He saw men lying dead upon the browning
hillsides; he heard wounded horses
screaming in their death agony; the earth
shook with the discharge of the heavy
guns; the crackling of the musketry fire
deafened him. The fife and drums, the uniformed
officers, the marching soldiery made
no appeal to Hadley Morris now. Wounds
and death were all about him, and fear
gripped his heart as though in a vice.
Time and again as he heard the shriek of
the bullets over his head he could have
fainted, or run away in abject terror, had
he dared! But the thought of being considered
a coward frightened him even more,
and he stayed.</p>

<p>Once, when there was a lull of heavy
firing on both sides, a strange sound
reached his ears. Captain Prentice’s command
was somewhat above and to one side
of the main line of battle, and this sound,
growing louder and more ear-piercing as
the strange silence continued, had such an
eerie effect upon the listener that Hadley
actually shook with a nervous chill, without
knowing what caused it. The sound was
little more than a murmur&mdash;yet a very insistent,
penetrating murmur.</p>

<p>“What is it?” Hadley whispered to the
man who stood next him in the broken
line.</p>

<p>“The cries of the wounded,” was the
stern reply, and the boy was glad when a
renewal of the conflict drowned the awful
sound.</p>

<p>No history fittingly tells the story of that
day’s struggle&mdash;the high hopes with which
the battle was begun by the Americans, the
determined, dogged resistance they offered
the British soldiery. Yet its salient points
are familiar enough. We do not like, even
now, to speak at length upon the defeats
of our arms even in that unequal war. But
without doubt, had not Sullivan blundered
and lost to the American cause a good
twelve hundred men, the Battle of the
Brandywine would have been placed upon
the list of American victories.</p>

<p>Hadley saw the patriot army driven back
and as they retreated he observed many of
the men weeping like women at the thought
of flying before an enemy which they had
practically held in check since early morning.
Captain Prentice, who had been recklessly
courageous during the engagement,
was wounded, yet still kept on the firing
line with his arm and shoulder swathed in
bandages. As they broke into the final disorderly
retreat, an aide galloped to the
young captain and said a word to him.</p>

<p>“Morris!” exclaimed Prentice, “follow
this man to Colonel Cadwalader. He
wants you. All’s lost here, anyway; there’s
nothing more to be done.”</p>

<p>Hadley threw down his musket and ran
beside the aide’s stirrup along the dusty
road for nearly a quarter of a mile before
overtaking the group of officers of which
Colonel Cadwalader was the centre. The
Colonel sat on his horse firmly and, despite
the creature’s dancing, was writing rapidly
on the pommel of his saddle.</p>

<p>“Morris,” he said, scarcely glancing at
the youth. “It is over for to-day. You
are not kept here with Captain Prentice by
any enlistment, I believe?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then you can go back if you wish&mdash;you
can go home. We shall retreat, and
whether His Excellency secures another
such chance to meet the enemy soon, we
know not. It is an awful thing&mdash;an awful
thing! But that is not why I called you.
There is a fresh horse yonder being held for
you. Here branches the road to Philadelphia.
You will not be molested, for the
British have not yet crossed it&mdash;though it’s
not sure they’ll not throw a column out between
us and the city.</p>

<p>“This letter goes to Holdness at the Indian
Queen Hotel in Fourth street&mdash;anybody
will direct you. Then, when it is delivered,
you may follow your own wishes,
Master Morris,” and the gentleman leaned
down and dropped the unsealed note into
the boy’s hand with a grave smile. “Leave
the horse where you exchanged steeds before
on the Germantown pike&mdash;you already
have a horse there, have you not?”</p>

<p>“I left one there, sir.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Now, off with you! I shall
see you anon&mdash;and hear more of you to
your credit, I believe,” and with a wave of
his hand Colonel Cadwalader dismissed
him.</p>

<p>Together with the men beside whom he
had fought Hadley was nigh heartbroken
over the result of the battle. The retreat
was almost a rout in some parts of the field.
The boy sprang upon the horse held by an
orderly, and at once dashed away through
the broken lines and soon left the disorganized
army behind. It was a bitter hour,
and, young as he was, the youth felt it
keenly. How would he be greeted in the
city toward which he was carrying the news
of the battle? He could imagine with what
despair the result of the struggle would be
received.</p>

<p>But he could not imagine all that had
occurred in the capital during the hours of
that fateful day. The days of anxiety and
suspense which had followed the landing
of the enemy culminated that morning
when the distant booming of heavy guns
announced the beginning of a general engagement
in the southwest. At the first
cannon shot many people left their houses
and collected in the streets, and all day long
their straining ears listened to the thunderous
muttering of the guns. About six
o’clock it died away, but the groups in the
street still listened and waited. The sun
set and supper-time came and went unnoticed
by those still remaining in the Quaker
City.</p>

<p>Naturally there were not any great number
of male adults, excepting the old men,
or those burdened by family or business
cares which actually forbade their being in
the ranks of the patriot army. Of course,
there were a few Tories left, but they were
not active, as had been Joseph Galloway
and the Allens before they were banished
from the town. There were no young
men&mdash;only boys and children hanging on
the skirts of the various groups about the
State House, or listening to the remarks
of the wise ones gathered before the doors
of the houses of public entertainment.</p>

<p>The women, too, whispered on their
doorsteps to each other, or craned their
necks out of the darkened windows to look
nervously along the street. The sound of
the guns had brought that grim, horrible
Thing called War so much nearer to them
than it had ever seemed before.</p>

<p>About eight o’clock there was some little
disturbance at one of the inns called the
Old Coffee House, where the story gained
credit that Washington had won a victory,
and some few began to cheer. But there
was no authority behind the story, and the
enthusiasm died out, and by nine o’clock
the suspense was actually painful.</p>

<p>At last, far out Chestnut street toward
the distant Schuylkill, there rose the sound
of rapid hoof-beats. As the approaching
horseman tore down the street voices rose
and hailed him as he passed, and soon the
clamor grew to a roar, which roused the
town for blocks around. The people ran
together toward the State House, and saw
a youth on a foam-flecked horse, covered
with dust, and exhausted, riding hard along
the rough way.</p>

<p>Once he drew rein for a moment to inquire
the way again to the Indian Queen;
but he refused to answer any questions until
he had ridden around into Fourth street
and stopped before the door of the old hostelry.</p>

<p>“Had Morris!” exclaimed a voice in the
crowd which poured out of the place, and
the lank figure of Lafe Holdness pushed
through the throng and helped the boy
from the saddle.</p>

<p>“What’s the news? Tell us of the battle!”
cried the crowd. “What does the lad
bring?”</p>

<p>Hadley thrust Colonel Cadwalader’s letter
into the scout’s hand first. Then he said
weakly to the anxious citizens: “There has
been a battle fought to-day; but there are
plenty of stragglers to tell you of it. There
is another messenger in town already&mdash;he
can tell you better than I.”</p>

<p>“But, is it defeat or victory?” somebody
cried.</p>

<p>“The army has been beaten&mdash;I don’t
know how badly. They say somebody
blundered, and General Washington is
obliged to fall back. The French Marquis
was wounded, I was told&mdash;seriously. The
army is marching northward and there will
be plenty of stragglers here soon.”</p>

<p>Then he clutched Holdness by his
sleeve. “Get me a bed, Lafe. I am nearly
dead with riding so far on top of all that’s
been done to-day. And I have no money.”</p>

<p>“Tut, tut!” exclaimed the Yankee.
“Never mind money here, lad. Ye’ll be
well entertained&mdash;I’ll speak to somebody
about ye. But I must be off myself at
once.”</p>

<p>And in ten minutes Hadley was alone
in a little room at the top of the house,
anxious to rest after his toilsome ride, while
Holdness was away on some business connected
with Colonel Cadwalader’s note.
The city was, however, in a tumult. Hadley’s
news had now been verified by a
dozen other messengers of ill-tidings, and
few in Philadelphia that night believed that
Washington could successfully oppose the
enemy again before Howe threw his troops
upon the city itself.</p>

<p>Indeed, when Hadley appeared in the
street the next morning to mount his horse
brought around by the stableman, the same
groups of excited citizens seemed to surround
the Indian Queen which had been
there the night before when he arrived.
As far as he could learn, everybody seemed
to believe that the city was doomed to capture
by the British, and that the defeat of
Brandywine could not be retrieved. A
night’s sleep, however, had renewed Hadley’s
courage as well as refreshed his body.
When he clattered out of town, following
the road northward toward Germantown,
he drew in, with every breath of the fresh
morning air, the feeling that all was not
yet lost. He remembered how bravely his
comrades had fought the day before; how
reluctant they had been to fall back, even
when commanded to do so. He thought
of General Washington himself, and a mental
picture of His Excellency’s stern, firmly
lined face rose before him. That was not
a man to give up&mdash;nor would General
Knox, nor Wayne, nor Colonel Cadwalader,
nor even young Captain Prentice!
Before he reached the farm-house where
he had left his horse, he was confident that
Philadelphia would not be given over to
the enemy without a second struggle.</p>

<p>And with that belief another idea entered
the boy’s mind. He had experienced a real
battle. It had frightened him, and the
thoughts of some of the awful things he
had seen and heard still troubled him; but
he felt that now, when he had been initiated
in war’s alarms, it was too bad that he
should not remain and fight again when
the patriots tried to keep the enemy out of
the city.</p>

<p>“I’ll go home as quick as ever I can and
beg uncle to let me go&mdash;he must let me
enlist!” the boy thought. “Anyway, if he
says ‘no,’ I’ll go just as I did this time, find
a gun, and stay as long as the battle’s on.
I know Jonas won’t care.”</p>

<p>He came again to the Ferry and crossed
it at night, Black Molly, he had found her
in good condition at the farmer’s, apparently
as eager to be home as himself. The
news of the disastrous battle had preceded
him, and everywhere Hadley was met by
anxious inquiries. He met no Tories, for
most of them had gone to join the British
forces; but the American farmers had again
lost hope.</p>

<p>As he was poled across the river one of
the ferrymen said to him: “Morris, ye’d
best watch sharply as ye go along home.
It is reported a party of Tories crossed
below here not two hours ago. They used
old Alwood’s bateau, and Brace Alwood is
with them. They’re meaning no good to
folks, I take it.”</p>

<p>“I thought all the Tories would be with
the King’s men,” said the boy. “I heard
on the road that they’ve sworn to march
into Philadelphia with the Redcoats when
the city is captured.”</p>

<p>“Well, Brace has got business of some
kind over here&mdash;and it isn’t any good business,
I’ll be bound. You’d better warn
Jonas. They may come to the inn.”</p>

<p>Hadley was somewhat troubled by this
information. Brace Alwood had been a
reckless sort of a young man before the
war broke out, and had incurred the enmity
of many of the neighbors. It was reported
that since he had joined the British he had
given full sway to his more harmful propensities,
and that he was noted among the
Tory hangers-on of the King’s troops for
his cruelty and bitter enmity against the
patriots. He had obtained some petty office
in the army, and now, with others, perhaps
as brutal as himself, had come into his
own neighborhood for no good purpose.
Surely, if he had crossed the river merely
to visit his father and mother, he would
not have brought a troop with him.</p>

<p>But Hadley saw nobody on the road until
he came abreast of his uncle’s property.
Then he did not see any man, but a light
in a clump of trees some distance back
from the horse-path, and in Miser Morris’
pasture, attracted his attention. This was
so strange a place for a fire, for a fire it
was Hadley could tell by the intermittent
leaping and fading of the light, that he could
not go by without investigating, and after
riding Black Molly a few rods beyond the
grove in question, he dismounted, tied her
to a fence rail, and crept over to reconnoitre.</p>

<p>There was a campfire in the middle of the
clump of trees. It was well hidden from
the house and outbuildings, and scarcely
discernible from the highway. But when
he got into the edge of the grove Hadley
saw with surprise that although the fire
was small there was a good-sized company
about the blaze. He counted eight heavily
armed and roughly dressed men lying about
the fire, but Brace Alwood, Lon’s older
brother, was not among them.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp53" id="i_eight-armed-men" style="max-width: 30em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_eight-armed-men.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">EIGHT HEAVILY ARMED MEN STOOD ABOUT THE FIRE</div>
</div>

<p>“Now, why should these fellows be roosting
here?” thought the American youth,
quite puzzled. “Of course they know that
most of our men are away now with the
army, and have they really come over here
to harass the unprotected homesteads? If
they have, and if they trouble the farmers’
wives, it will be too hot about here for the
Alwoods to stay when the men do come
back.”</p>

<p>A crackling in the bushes startled him,
and he crouched lower. The Tories
seemed so sure of their position that they
did not keep a guard, and now two other
figures came rapidly into the circle of the
firelight, Hadley noticing that their approach
was from the direction of his uncle’s
house. An instant later he recognized
Brace Alwood, the probable leader of this
party of bushwhackers. He was grown
much older looking since he had left home,
and his bronzed face was covered by a
tangled growth of beard. His companion
he held by the arm, and Hadley saw that it
was Alonzo.</p>

<p>“Here he is, boys,” declared Brace, with
a laugh. “He’s young, but he’s sharp&mdash;a
reg’lar fox for cunning. I found him
watching the premises yonder, and he tells
me everybody’s gone for the night, and
the old man is in the house. All we got
to do is to wait an hour or so till things
get thoroughly quieted down, and then
make our call. Miser Morris’ll be glad to
see us, eh?” and the fellow laughed unpleasantly.</p>

<p class="h2sub">By WILLIAM MURRAY GRAYDON</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>F there is any one incident in my past
life that I particularly dislike to dwell
upon, it is the night I spent in a lonely
mountain cabin in Northwestern Arizona.</p>

<p>I had left the little mining settlement of
San Rosa early that morning to visit a ranch
belonging to a friend of mine that lay some
ten or twelve miles to the westward.</p>

<p>I had never been there before, but from
the directions given me, I felt sure I could
find the place without difficulty.</p>

<p>I had to cross two or three mountain
spurs, and pass through a couple of deep
ravines to reach the high stretch of table
land where the ranch was located.</p>

<p>I am fond of sport, and to this must be
attributed the adventure which placed me
in such peril. At sunrise I was four or five
miles on my way, and while riding through
a deep wooded hollow, I discovered bear
tracks in a bit of soft ground, which had the
appearance of being fresh.</p>

<p>Here was a temptation too great to be
resisted, and, hoping to obtain a shot at
Bruin, I followed the trail up the side of the
ridge. The footprints which were too small
to be those of a grizzly, soon vanished, of
course, but I rode on over the hilltop and
down into the ravine beyond, eager to get a
glimpse of the animal.</p>

<p>But Bruin failed to make his appearance,
though I followed the hollow for several
miles, and finally concluded to give up the
search and strike for my destination.</p>

<p>But here I was confronted by a puzzling
problem.</p>

<p>I had passed several intersecting ravines
on my way, and now I was utterly at a loss
which one to take.</p>

<p>I made a speedy choice, however, for
there was no time to lose in hesitation, and
rode briskly on for two or three hours.</p>

<p>But none of the landmarks which I had
been warned to look for appeared, and I
had to admit that I was lost.</p>

<p>It was now about four o’clock in the afternoon,
and the setting sun showed that I had
been traveling in the proper direction&mdash;in
the general sense of the word, but whether
the ranch was close at hand or not, I had
not the remotest idea.</p>

<p>Some distance ahead I could detect the
sound of running water, so I concluded to
slake my thirst, and then strike for the
highest point of ground to be found
where I could obtain a view of the
country.</p>

<p>In a moment I saw the water sparkling at
the bottom of the ravine, and, as I rode
down to the spot, a startling and unpleasant
sight met my eyes.</p>

<p>Two men, an evil-faced Mexican and an
Apache Indian, were sitting by the side of a
great rock. Their horses were tied to saplings
a few feet away, and their arms, I
noted with relief, were lying on the ground,
almost equally distant.</p>

<p>The surprise was mutual, for the mossy
path had muffled the sound of my horse’s
hoofs.</p>

<p>I recognized both instantly. The Mexican
was Luiz Castro, a man who bore a bad
name among the settlements, and his companion
was Scarface&mdash;so called from a
couple of ugly knife marks on his cheek&mdash;and
a very bad Indian, indeed, if reports
were to be believed.</p>

<p>The Apache had been driven from his
tribe for some misdemeanor, and for several
years he and the Mexican had been inseparable
companions&mdash;a very odd friendship,
to say the least.</p>

<p>I concluded not to stop for a drink at that
spring.</p>

<p>“Can you tell me the way to Block’s
Ranch?” I inquired, respectfully.</p>

<p>The Apache looked at me stolidly, but
Castro quickly replied:</p>

<p>“Si, señor; straight ahead through yonder
ravine. You can’t miss it.”</p>

<p>I thanked him, and nodding briefly, rode
on. The ravine referred to was just ahead,
and I had gone a mile or more when the
suspicion suddenly occurred to me that
Castro might have misdirected me for some
evil purpose.</p>

<p>I carried quite a sum of money which I
had no desire to lose, and as rapidly as possible
I rode on until a sudden gloom warned
me that darkness was at hand. The ravine
showed no signs of terminating, and my
suspicion became a certainty.</p>

<p>The two scoundrels had guided me to this
lonely spot with the intention, no doubt, of
waylaying and shooting me. They were
quite capable of such a deed, I well knew.</p>

<p>I shivered at the thought, and taking a
hasty glance behind, put spurs to my mustang
and trotted ahead as rapidly as the
narrow, uncertain path would allow.</p>

<p>In five minutes the ravine widened and I
saw a small clearing just ahead, in the
centre of which was a rude log cabin. I
rode eagerly to the door and was disappointed
to find it empty. Some lonely
miner, perhaps, had once lived there until
he either met a violent death or abandoned
the place in search of a better claim.</p>

<p>It was now quite dusk, and I realized the
hopelessness of proceeding farther that
night.</p>

<p>The ravine narrowed again just ahead,
and the steep ridges on each side forbade
any attempt at climbing.</p>

<p>My mind was made up in an instant.
Here I must spend the night.</p>

<p>I hastily picketed my horse outside where
he could find plenty of grass, and entered
the cabin. I was agreeably surprised to
find it in such good condition. The door
was firm on its hinges, and sockets on each
side seemed to invite the heavy bar that was
lying close by on the floor. The window
shutter could be secured in the same way.</p>

<p>I lost no time in securing the door and
window, and then I felt comparatively safe,
for I was well armed with a Winchester
and a pair of revolvers.</p>

<p>I had crackers and jerked beef in my
knapsack, and, making a cheerful blaze in
the fireplace, I ate a hearty lunch. Then I
lit my pipe and sat down with my back
against the wall where the heat could easily
reach me.</p>

<p>I could hear my horse moving about outside,
but no other sound reached me; and I
began to be ashamed of my fears. I
smoked and pondered for two or three
hours, and I was just considering the advisability
of bringing my horse inside the
cabin for better security, when, without the
least warning, a sharp report rang in my
ears, and a bullet buried itself in the log
within an inch of my face.</p>

<p>Startled as I was, I had sufficient presence
of mind to throw myself flat on the floor,
grasping my rifle in the fall.</p>

<p>I did not intend this for a ruse, but my
unknown enemy evidently thought I had
fallen from the effects of his bullet, for instantly
I heard a thumping on the door, and
a few words spoken in a low voice. Castro
and the Apache were outside, I had no
doubt.</p>

<p>The shot was fired through a chink in
the logs, and, creeping over the floor, I put
my Winchester to the orifice and let fire
twice in succession, to let them know that
I was not a dead man yet, and determined
not to be one if I could help it.</p>

<p>A hasty glance at the cabin walls showed
me that wide cracks abounded everywhere,
and, alarmed at the peril I was in, I tore off
my coat, and, running swiftly to the fireplace,
smothered the blaze and stamped out
the embers.</p>

<p>I breathed easier when this was done, for,
of course, my foes could not do any accurate
shooting in the dark. Then I sat
down in the centre of the floor to await the
next move. It was a trying situation, and
the thought of spending the long hours of
the night in baffling the attempts of two
would-be assassins was terrifying.</p>

<p>For a long time all was quiet, and then
I heard them fumbling at the door and the
window. This gave me little concern. I
knew they could not force an entrance
there.</p>

<p>Then another hour went by, and I was
beginning to hope the miscreants had abandoned
their scheme, when I suddenly became
aware that some one was on the roof.
I understood instantly what this meant.
My foes intended to come down the chimney.</p>

<p>The sounds were so loud and so close
that I believed one of them to be already
descending, and snatching an armful of
straw from the pallet, I dashed it on the
fireplace and applied a match.</p>

<p>A few seconds later I realized what a
dangerous trap I had blundered into, for as
the blaze flooded the room with light, a
rifle cracked, and I was knocked forcibly to
the floor.</p>

<p>I believed for a moment that I was mortally
wounded, but a little later I found that
the bullet had struck my watch and glanced
harmlessly off, after shattering the works.</p>

<p>I was not slow to comprehend the trick
that had been played on me, and without
any delay I crept to one corner of the room,
which by this time was comparatively dark,
for the straw had nearly burnt itself out.
One of the fellows had remained below,
ready to shoot, while his confederate
worked the cunningly laid scheme from the
roof.</p>

<p>For a time I was pretty sore from the
shock, and then I began to fear that as a
last resource they would come down the
chimney in earnest.</p>

<p>I concluded to be on the safe side by preparing
for such an emergency, and as the
fire was now out, I gathered up what straw
remained and piled it in the chimney place,
ready to use if occasion required, though I
determined to make sure that my enemy
was actually on his way down before I
flooded the cabin with light again.</p>

<p>I suppose two hours must have passed
this time without the slightest move from
the miscreants, but I remained watchful and
alert, with my Winchester on my knee.</p>

<p>Then I was startled to see a tiny flame
licking the base of the straw pile. Some
sparks must have lingered in the embers of
the previous fire, and I rose quickly to put
out the blaze.</p>

<p>But before I could reach the spot the tiny
flame had expanded with startling celerity,
and the fireplace was a glowing furnace.</p>

<p>I looked hurriedly around for shelter, but,
before I could move, a hoarse cry rang out
from the chimney, and down tumbled Scarface,
the Apache, into the seething fire.</p>

<p>I dashed forward and dragged him out
on the floor by one leg, before the flames
could do him serious injury. He was
stunned from the fall, though, and before he
was able to offer any resistance, I had him
securely bound, hand and foot, with a
strong rope that I fortunately chanced to
have in my pocket.</p>

<p>During this time Castro was probably on
the roof, for no shots were fired through
the logs; and, as the straw burned itself out,
I felt that the siege had ended in my favor.</p>

<p>From Scarface I had nothing to fear, and
I knew that the cowardly Mexican would
not attempt to carry out a plan at which
his comrade had failed so disastrously.</p>

<p>The Indian spent the remainder of the
night in groaning, and when the welcome
daylight shone through the logs my friend,
Block, arrived on the scene with several of
his ranchmen, and my siege was over.</p>

<p>The ranch turned out to be only two
miles away. My friend had been expecting
me on the previous day, and the sound of
shooting during the night led him to make
a search in this direction.</p>

<p>Castro had decamped, taking my horse
with him, but he was captured at a neighboring
settlement a week later.</p>

<p>Scarface recovered from his burns and
was handed over to the sheriff, who put him
where he was not likely to injure any person
for some time to come.</p>

<p>My escape that night was truly a providential
one. The crafty Apache had been
stealing without a sound down the broad
chimney, when the little spark that was
smouldering for hours burst into a blaze at
just the right moment, for if Scarface had
gained the interior of the cabin this story
would probably have never been written.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI<br />
Departure</h3>

<h4>SYNOPSIS OF PREVIOUS CHAPTERS.</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Brought up in the forests of northern Maine, and
seeing few persons excepting her uncle and Angelique,
the Indian housekeeper, Margot Romeyn knows
little of life beyond the deep hemlocks. Naturally
observant, she is encouraged in her out-of-door
studies by her uncle, at one time a college professor.
Through her woodland instincts, she and her uncle
are enabled to save the life of Adrian Wadislaw,
a youth who, lost and almost overcome with hunger,
has been wandering in the neighboring forest. To
Margot the new friend is a welcome addition to her
small circle of acquaintances, and after his rapid
recovery she takes great delight in showing him the
many wonders of the forest about her home.
Many weeks later, in one of their conversations,
a remark from Adrian causes Margot to question
her uncle as to her father’s whereabouts. It is
just this knowledge that her guardian, knowing it
to be best, has so carefully kept from her. Fearing
that Adrian’s presence might, in some way, increase
the girl’s interest in her father, he puts the matter
before the young man. It is then decided that it
were better for Adrian to take his departure.</p>
</div>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="dropcap">B</span>UT Adrian need not have dreaded the
interview to which his host had summoned
him. Mr. Dutton’s face was
a little graver than usual, but his manner
was even more kind. He was a man to
whom justice seemed the highest good, who
had himself suffered most bitterly from injustice.
He was forcing himself to be perfectly
fair with the lad, and it was even with
a smile that he motioned toward a chair
opposite himself. The chair stood in the
direct light of the lamp, but Adrian did not
notice that.</p>

<p>“Do not fear me, Adrian, though for a
moment I forgot myself. For you, personally&mdash;personally&mdash;I
have only great
good will. But&mdash;will you answer my questions,
believing that it a painful necessity
which compels them?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>“One word more. Beyond the fact,
which you confided to Margot, that you
were a runaway, I know no details of your
past life. I have wished not to know and
have refrained from any inquiries. I must
now break that silence. What&mdash;is your
father’s name?”</p>

<p>As he spoke the man’s hands gripped the
arms of his chair more tightly, like one prepared
for an unpleasant answer.</p>

<p>“Malachi Wadislaw.”</p>

<p>The questioner waited a moment, during
which he seemed to be thinking profoundly.
Then he rallied his own judgment. It was
an uncommon name, but there might be
two men bearing it. That was not impossible.</p>

<p>“Where does he live?”</p>

<p>“Number &mdash;, Madison Avenue, New
York.”</p>

<p>A longer silence than before, broken by
a long drawn “A-ah!” There might, indeed,
be two men of one name, but not two
residing at that once familiar locality.</p>

<p>“Adrian, when you asked my niece that
question about her father, did you&mdash;had
you&mdash;tell me what was in your mind.”</p>

<p>The lad’s face showed nothing but frank
astonishment.</p>

<p>“Why, nothing, sir, beyond an idle curiosity.
And I’m no end sorry for my
thoughtlessness. I’ve seen how tenderly
you both watch her mother’s grave, and I
wondered where her father’s was. That
was all. I had no business to have done
it&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It was natural. It was nothing wrong,
in itself. But&mdash;unfortunately, it suggested
to Margot what I have studiously kept from
her. For reasons which I think best to
keep to myself, it is impossible to run the
risk of other questions which may arouse
other speculations in her mind. I have
been truly glad that she could for a time, at
least, have the companionship of one nearer
her own age than Angelique or myself, but
now&mdash;”</p>

</div>

<p>He paused significantly, and Adrian hastened
to complete the unfinished sentence.</p>

<p>“Now it is time for her to return to her
ordinary way of life. I understand you, of
course. And I am going away at once.
Indeed, I did start, not meaning to come
back, but&mdash;I will&mdash;how can I do
so sir? If I could swim&mdash;”</p>

<p>Mr. Dutton’s drawn face softened
into something like a smile;
and again, most gently, he motioned
the excited boy to resume
his seat. As he did so, he opened
a drawer of the table and produced
a purse that seemed to be
well filled.</p>

<p>“Wait. There is no such
haste, nor are you in such dire
need as you seem to think. You
have worked well and faithfully,
and relieved me of much hard
labor that I have not, somehow,
felt just equal to. I have
kept an account for you, and, if
you will be good enough to see
if it is right, I will hand you the
amount due you.”</p>

<p>He pushed a paper toward
Adrian, who would not, at first,
touch it.</p>

<p>“You owe me nothing, sir, nor
can I take anything. I thank
you for your hospitality, and
some time”&mdash;he stopped, choked,
and made a telling gesture. It
said plainly enough that his pride
was just then deeply humiliated,
but that he would have his revenge
at some future day.</p>

<p>“Sit down, lad. I do not
wonder at your feeling, nor
would you at mine if you knew
all. Under other circumstances
we should have been the best of
friends. It is impossible for me
to be more explicit, and it
hurts my pride as much to bid you go as
yours to be sent. Some time&mdash;but, no
matter. What we have in hand is to arrange
for your departure as speedily and
comfortably as possible. I would suggest”&mdash;but
his words had the force of a
command&mdash;“that Pierre convey you to the
nearest town from which, by stage or railway,
you can reach any further place you
choose. If I were to offer advice, it would
be to go home. Make your peace there;
and then, if you desire a life in the woods,
seek such with the consent and approval of
those to whom your duty is due.”</p>

<p>Adrian said nothing at first; then remarked:</p>

<p>“Pierre need not go so far. Across the
lake to the mainland is enough. I can
travel on foot afterward, and I know more
about the forest now than when I lost myself,
and you, or Margot, found me. I owe
my life to you. I am sorry I have given
you pain. Sorry for many things.”</p>

<p>“There are few who have not something
to regret; for anything that has happened
here no apology is necessary. As for saving
life, that was by God’s will. Now&mdash;to
business. You will see that I have reckoned
your wages the same as Pierre’s&mdash;thirty
dollars a month and ‘found,’ as the
farmers say, though it has been much more
difficult to find him than you. You have
been here nearly three months, and eighty
dollars is yours.”</p>

<p>“Eighty dollars! Whew! I mean, impossible.
In the first place, I haven’t
earned it; in the second, I couldn’t take it
from&mdash;from you&mdash;if I had. How could a
man take money from one who had saved
his life?”</p>

<p>“Easily, I hope, if he has common sense.
You exaggerate the service we were able to
do you, which we would have rendered to
anybody. Your earnings will start you
straight again. Take them, and oblige me
by making no further objections.”</p>

<p>Despite his protests, which were honest,
Adrian could not but be delighted at the
thought of possessing so goodly a sum. It
was the first money he had ever earned,
therefore better than any other ever could
be, and as he put it, in his own thoughts,
“it changed him from a beggar to a prince.”
Yet he made a final protest, asking:</p>

<p>“Have I really, really, and justly earned
all this? Do you surely mean it?”</p>

<p>“I am not in the habit of saying anything
I do not mean. It is getting late, and if
you are to go to-night, it would be better to
start soon,” answered Mr. Dutton, with a
frown.</p>

<p>“Beg pardon. But I’m always saying
what I should not, or putting the right
things backward. There are some affairs
‘not mentioned in the bond’: my artist’s
outfit, these clothes, boots, and other matters.
I want to pay the cost of them. Indeed,
I must. You must allow me, as you
would any other man.”</p>

<p>The woodlander hesitated a moment as if
he were considering. He would have preferred
no return for anything, but again
that effort to be wholly just influenced him.</p>

<p>“For the clothing, if you so desire, certainly.
Here, in this account book, is a
price list of all such articles as I buy. We
will deduct that much. But I hope, in consideration
of the pleasure that your talent
has given me, that you will accept the painting
stuff I so gladly provided. If you
choose, also, you may leave a small gift for
Angelique. Come. Pride is commendable,
but not always.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Thank you, then, for your
gift. Now, the price list.”</p>

<p>It had been a gratification to Mr. Dutton
that Adrian had never worn the suits of
clothing which he had laid out ready for
use on that morning after his arrival at the
island. The lad had preferred the rougher
costume suited to the woods, and still
wore it.</p>

<p>In a few moments the small business
transactions were settled, and Adrian rose.</p>

<p>“I would like to bid Margot good-by.
But, I suppose, she has gone to bed.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I will give her your message.
There is always a pain in parting, and you
two have been much together. I would
spare her as much as I can. Angelique
has packed a basket of food and Pierre is
on the beach with his canoe. He may go
as far with you as you desire, and you must
pay him nothing for his service. He is
already paid, though his greed might make
him despoil you, if he could. Good-by. I
wish you well.”</p>

<p>Mr. Dutton had also risen, and as he
moved forward into the lamplight, Adrian
noticed how much altered for the worse was
his physical bearing. The man seemed to
have aged many years, and his fine head
was now snow-white. He half extended
his hand, in response to the lad’s proffered
clasp, then dropped it to his side. He
hoped that the departing guest had not observed
this inhospitable movement&mdash;but he
had. Possibly, it helped him over an awkward
moment, by touching his pride afresh.</p>

<p>“Good-by, sir, and again&mdash;thank you.
For the present, that is all I can do. Yet
I have heard it was not so big a world, after
all, and my chance may come. I’ll get my
traps from my room, if you please, and one
or two little drawings as souvenirs. I’ll not
be long.”</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later Pierre was paddling
vigorously toward the further side of the
lake and Adrian was straining his eyes for
the last glimpse of the beautiful island
which, even now, in his banishment from
it, seemed his real and beloved home. It
became a vague and shadowy outline, as
silent as the stars that brooded over it; and
again he marveled what the mystery might
be which enshrouded it, and why he should
be connected with it.</p>

<p>“Now that I am no longer its guest, there
is no dishonor in my finding out; and find
out&mdash;I will!”</p>

<p>“Hey?” asked Pierre, so suddenly that
Adrian jumped and nearly upset the boat.
“Oh! I thought you said somethin’. Say,
ain’t this a go? What you done that make
the master shut the door on you? I never
knew him do it before. Hey?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. Keep quiet. I don’t feel like
talking.”</p>

<p>“Pr-r-r-rp! Look a here, young fello’.
Me and you’s alone on this dead water, and
I can swim&mdash;you can’t. I’ve got all I expect
to get out of the trip, and I’ve no notion
o’ makin’ it. Not ’less things go to my
thinkin’. Now, I’ll rest a spell. You
paddle!”</p>

<p>With that he began to rock the frail craft
violently, and Adrian’s attention was recalled
to the necessity of saving his own
life.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>CHAPTER XII<br />
A DISCLOSURE</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>S the sun rose, Margot came out of her
own room, fresh from her plunge that
had washed all drowsiness away, as
the good sleep had also banished all perplexities.
Happy at all times, she was most
so at morning, when, to her nature-loving
eyes, the world seemed to have been made
anew and doubly beautiful. The gay little
melodies she had picked up from Pierre, or
Angelique&mdash;who had been a sweet singer in
her day&mdash;and now again from Adrian, were
always on her lips at such an hour, and were
dear beyond expression to her uncle’s ears.</p>

<p>But this morning she seemed to be singing
them to the empty air. There was nobody
in the living room, nor in the “study-library,”
as the housekeeper called the
room of books, nor even in the kitchen.
That was the oddest of all! For there, at
least, should Angelique have been, frying,
or stewing, or broiling, as the case might
be. Yet the coffee stood simmering at one
corner of the hearth and a bowl of eggs
waited ready for the omelet which Angelique
could make to perfection.</p>

<p>“Why, how still it is! As if everybody
had gone away and left the island alone.”</p>

<p>She ran to the door and called, “Adrian!”</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>“Pierre! Angelique! Where is everybody?”</p>

<p>Then she saw Angelique coming down
the slope and ran to meet her. With one
hand the woman carried a brimming pail
of milk and with the other dragged by his
collar the reluctant form of Reynard, who
appeared as guilty and subdued as if he had
been born a slave, not free. To make matters
more difficult, Meroude was surreptitiously
helping herself to a breakfast from
the pail and thereby ruining its contents for
other uses.</p>

<p>“Oh! the plague of a life with such
beasts! And him the worst o’ they all.
The ver’ next time my Pierre goes cross-lake,
that fox goes or I do! There’s no
room on the island for the two of us. No.
Indeed, no. The harm comes of takin’ in
folks and beasties and friendin’ them ’at
don’t deserve it. What now, think you?”</p>

<p>Margot had run the faster, as soon as
she descried poor Reynard’s abject state,
and had taken him under her own protection,
which immediately restored him to his
natural pride and noble bearing.</p>

<p>“I think nothing evil of my pet, believe
that! See the beauty now! That’s the difference
between harsh words and loving
ones. If you’d only treat the ‘beasties’ as
well as you do me, Angelique, dear, you’d
have less cause for scolding. What I think
now is&mdash;speckled rooster. Right?”</p>

<p>“Aye. Dead as dead; and the feathers
still stickin’ in the villain’s jaws. What’s
the life of such brutes to that o’ good fowls?
Pst! Meroude! Scat! Well, if it’s milk
you will, milk you shall!” and, turning angrily
about, Snowfoot’s mistress dashed the
entire contents of her pail over the annoying
cat.</p>

<p>Margot laughed till the tears came.
“Why, Angelique! only the other day, in
that quaint old ‘Book of Beauty’ uncle has,
I read how a Queen of Naples, and some
noted Parisian beauties used baths of milk
for their complexions; but poor Meroude’s
a hopeless case, I fear.”</p>

<p>Angelique’s countenance took on a grim
expression. “Mistress Meroude’s got a
day’s job to clean herself, the greedy.
It’s not her nose’ll go in the pail another
mornin’. No, no, indeed.”</p>

<p>“And it was so full. Yet that’s the same
Snowfoot who was to give us no more, because
of the broken glass. Angelique,
where’s uncle?”</p>

<p>“How should I tell? Am I set to spy the
master’s ins and outs?”</p>

<p>“Funny, Angelique! You’re not set to
do it, but you can usually tell them. And
where’s Adrian? I’ve called and called, but
nobody answers. I can’t guess where they
all are. Even Pierre is out of sight, and
he’s mostly to be found at the kitchen door
when meal time comes.”</p>

<p>“There, there, child. You can ask more
questions than old Angelique can answer.
But the breakfast. That’s a good thought.
So be. Whisk in and mix the batter cakes
for the master’s eatin’. ’Tis he, foolish
man, finds they have better savor from Margot’s
fingers than mine. Simple one, with
all his wisdom.”</p>

<p>“It’s love gives them savor, sweet Angelique,
and the desire to see me a proper
housewife. I wonder why he cares about
that, since you are here to do such things.”</p>

<p>“Ah! The ‘I wonders!’ and the ‘Is its?’
of a maid! They set the head awhirl. The
batter cakes, my child. I see the master
comin’ down the hill this minute.”</p>

<p>Margot paused long enough to caress
Tom, the eagle, who met her on the path,
then sped indoors, leaving Reynard to his
own devices and Angelique’s not too tender
mercies. But she put all her energy into
the task assigned her and proudly placed
a plate of her uncle’s favorite dainty before
him when he took his seat at the table.
Till then she had not noticed its altered arrangement,
and even her guardian’s coveted
“Well done, little housekeeper!” could
not banish the sudden fear that assailed
her.</p>

<p>“Why, what does it mean? Where is
Adrian? Where is Pierre? Why are only
dishes for three?”</p>

<p>“Pst! ma p’tite! Hast been askin’ questions
in the sleep. Sure, you have ever
since your eyes flew open. Say your grace
and eat your meat, and let the master rest.”</p>

<p>“Yes, darling, Angelique is wise. Eat
your breakfast as usual, and afterward I
will tell you all&mdash;that you should know.”</p>

<p>“But I cannot eat. It chokes me. It
seems so awfully still and strange and
empty. As I should think it might be were
somebody dead.”</p>

<p>Angelique’s scant patience was exhausted.
Not only was her loyal heart
tried by her master’s troubles, but she had
had added labor to accomplish. During all
that summer two strong and, at least one,
willing lad had been at hand to do the various
chores pertaining to all country homes,
however isolated. That morning she had
brought in her own supply of firewood,
filled her buckets from the spring, attended
the poultry, fed the oxen, milked Snowfoot,
wrestled over the iniquity of Reynard, and
grieved at the untimely death of the
speckled rooster. “When he would have
made such a lovely fricassee. Yes, indeed,
’twas a sinful waste!”</p>

<p>Though none of these tasks were new or
arduous to her, she had not performed them
during the past weeks, save and except the
care of her cow. That she had never entrusted
to anybody, not even the master;
and it was to spare him that she had done
some of the things he meant to attend to
later. Now she had reached her limit.</p>

<p>“Angelique wants her breakfast, child.
She has been long astir. After that the
deluge!” quoted Mr. Dutton, with an attempt
at lightness which did not agree with
his real depression.</p>

<p>Margot made heroic efforts to act as
usual, but they ended in failure, and as soon
as might be her guardian pushed back his
chair, and she promptly did the same.</p>

<p>“Now, I can ask as many questions as I
please, can’t I? First, where are they?”</p>

<p>“They have gone across the lake, southward,
I suppose. Toward whatever place
or town Adrian selects. He will not come
back, but Pierre will do so, after he has
guided the other to some safe point beyond
the woods. How soon I do not know, of
course.”</p>

<p>“Gone! Without bidding me good-by?
Gone to stay? Oh, uncle, how could he?
I know you didn’t like him, but I did. He
was&mdash;”</p>

<p>Margot dropped her face in her hands
and sobbed bitterly. Then ashamed of her
unaccustomed tears, she ran out of the
house and as far from it as she could. But
even the blue herons could give her no
amusement, though they stalked gravely up
the river bank and posed beside her, where
she lay prone and disconsolate in Harmony
Hollow. Her squirrels saw and wondered,
for she had no returning chatter for them,
even when they chased one another over
her prostrate person and playfully pulled at
her long hair.</p>

<p>“He was the only friend I ever had that
was not old and wise in sorrow. It was
true he seemed to bring a shadow with him,
and while he was here I sometimes wished
he would go, or had never come; yet now
that he has&mdash;oh, it’s so awfully, awfully
lonesome. Nobody to talk with about my
dreams and fancies, nobody to talk nonsense,
nobody to teach me any more songs&mdash;nobody
but just old folks and animals.
And he went&mdash;he went without a word or a
single good-by!”</p>

<p>It was, indeed, Margot’s first grief; and
the fact that her late comrade could leave
her so coolly, without even mentioning his
plan, hurt her very deeply. But, after
awhile, resentment at Adrian’s seeming
neglect almost banished her loneliness; and,
sitting up, she stared at Xanthippé, poised
on one leg before her, apparently asleep
but really waiting for anything which might
turn up in the shape of dainties.</p>

<p>“Oh, you sweet vixen! but you needn’t
‘pose.’ There’s no artist here now to
sketch you, and I don’t care, not very much,
if there isn’t. After all my trying to do
him good, praising and blaming and petting,
if he was impolite enough to go as he
did&mdash;Well, no matter!”</p>

<p>While this indignation lasted she felt better,
but as soon as she came once more in
sight of the clearing and of her uncle finishing
one of Adrian’s uncompleted tasks,
her loneliness returned with double force.
It had almost the effect of bodily illness,
and she had no experience to guide her.
With a fresh burst of tears she caught her
guardian’s hand and hid her face on his
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Oh! it’s so desolate. So empty. Everything’s
so changed. Even the Hollow is
different and the squirrels seem like strangers.
If he had to go, why did he ever,
ever come!”</p>

<p>“Why, indeed!”</p>

<p>Mr. Dutton was surprised and frightened
by the intensity of her grief. If she could
sorrow in this way for a brief friendship,
what untold misery might not life have in
store for her? There must have been some
serious blunder in his training if she were
no better fitted than this to face trouble;
and for the first time it occurred to him
that he should not have kept her from all
companions of her own age.</p>

<p>“Margot!”</p>

<p>The sternness of his tone made her look
up and calm herself.</p>

<p>“Y-es, uncle.”</p>

<p>“This must stop. Adrian went by my
invitation. Because I could no longer permit
your association. Between his household
and ours is a wrong beyond repair.
He cannot help that he is his father’s son,
but being such, he is an impossible friend
for your father’s daughter. I should have
sent him away at my very first suspicion of
his identity, but&mdash;I want to be just. It
has been the effort of my life to learn forgiveness.
Until the last I would not allow
myself even to believe who he was, but
gave him the benefit of the chance that his
name might be of another family. When
I did know&mdash;there was no choice. He had
to go.”</p>

<p>Margot watched his face as he spoke,
with a curious feeling that this was not the
loved and loving uncle she had always
known, but a stranger. There were wrinkles
and scars she had never noticed, a bitterness
that made the voice an unfamiliar
one, and a weariness in the droop of the
figure leaning upon the hoe which suggested
an aged and heartbroken man.</p>

<p>Why, only yesterday, it seemed, Hugh
Dutton was the very type of a stalwart
woodlander, with the grace of a finished
and untiring scholar, making the man
unique. Now, if Adrian had done this
thing, if his mere presence had so altered
her beloved guardian, then let Adrian go!
Her arms went round the man’s neck and
her kisses showered upon his cheeks, his
hands, even his bent white head.</p>

<p>“Uncle, uncle! Don’t look like that!
Don’t. He’s gone and shall never come
back. Everything’s gone, hasn’t it? Even
that irreparable past, of which I’d never
heard. Why, if I’d dreamed, do you suppose
I’d even ever have spoken to him?
No, indeed. Why, you, the tip of your
smallest finger, the smallest lock of your
hair, is worth more than a thousand Adrians!
I was sorry he treated me so rudely,
but now I’m glad, glad, glad. I wouldn’t
listen to him now, not if he said good-by
forever and ever. I love you, uncle, best
of all the world, and you love me. Let’s
be just as we were before any strangers
came. Come, let’s go out on the lake.”</p>

<p>He smiled at her extravagance and
abruptness. The times when they had
gone canoeing together had been their merriest,
happiest times. It seemed to her that
it needed only some such outing to restore
the former conditions of their life.</p>

<p>“Not to-day, dearest.”</p>

<p>“Why not? The potatoes won’t hurt,
and it’s so lovely.”</p>

<p>“There are other matters, more important
than potatoes. I have put them off
too long. Now&mdash;Margot, do you love me?”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;uncle?”</p>

<p>“Because there is somebody whom you
must love even more dearly. Your father.”</p>

<p>“My&mdash;father! My father? Of course;
though he is dead.”</p>

<p>“No, Margot. He is still alive.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>CHAPTER XIII<br />
CARRYING</h3>
  </div>

<p><span class="dropcap">P</span>IERRE’S ill temper was short-lived, but
his curiosity remained. However,
when Adrian steadily refused to
gratify it his interest returned to himself.</p>

<p>“Say, I’ve a mind to go the whole way.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“Wherever you’re going. Nothing to
call me back.”</p>

<p>“Madoc?”</p>

<p>“We might take him along.”</p>

<p>“Not if he’s sick. That would be as cruel
to him as troublesome to us. Besides, you
need go no further than yonder shore.”</p>

<p>“Them’s the woods you got lost in.”</p>

<p>“I know them better now.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t find your road to save your
life.”</p>

<p>“I think I could. Besides, you will be
wanted at the island. I don’t think Mr.
Dutton is a well man. With nobody but
an old woman and a young girl he’ll need
somebody. You’re not much good, still&mdash;”</p>

<p>Pierre laughed. They had about reached
the forest and he rested his paddle.</p>

<p>“You hear me. I’m going to where you
go. That was the master’s word. I
wouldn’t dare not do it. If I did, my
mother’d make me sorry. So that’s settled.”</p>

<p>Adrian had doubts as to the truth of this
statement of the islander’s commands. He
recalled the words, “as far as you desire.”
After all, this was not setting a time limit,
and it was perfectly natural that anybody
should like company through the wilderness.
Why, it would be a wild, adventurous
journey! the very sort of which he
had dreamed before he had tasted the prosaic
routine of the lumber camp. He had
his colors and brushes, the birch-bark
which served so many forest purposes
should be his canvas. They had food, and
Pierre, at least, his gun and ammunition&mdash;no
lad could have protested further.</p>

<p>“All right. It will be a lark after my
own heart. We can quit as soon as we’re
tired of it; and&mdash;look here, Mr. Dutton said
you were paid to take me to the nearest
town. How far is that? How long to get
there?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. Donovan’s nighest.
Might go in four days&mdash;might a week.
Canada’s closer, but you don’t want to go
north. South, he said.”</p>

<p>“Ye-es. I suppose so. Fact is, I don’t
care where I go nor when. I’m in no
hurry. As long as the money and food
hold out, I’m satisfied.”</p>

<p>“Speakin’ of money, I couldn’t afford to
waste my time.”</p>

<p>Adrian laughed at this sudden change of
front. It was Pierre who had proposed the
long road, but at the mention of money
had remembered prudence.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, too. It was of that I
was thinking, you greedy fellow. What do
guides get here in the woods?”</p>

<p>Pierre stepped ashore, carefully beached
his canoe, and as carefully considered his
reply before he made it. How much did
this city lad know? Either at camp or on
the island had he heard the just rates of
such service?</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;how much you got?”</p>

<p>“I’m asking a question, not you.”</p>

<p>“About four dollars, likely.”</p>

<p>“Whew! not much. You can get the
best of them for two. I’ll give you a dollar
a day when we’re resting and one-fifty when
we’re traveling.”</p>

<p>Adrian was smiling in the darkness at his
own sudden thrift. He had taken a leaf
out of his comrade’s book, and beyond
that, he almost loved his precious earnings,
so soon as the thought came of parting with
them. He instantly resolved to put aside a
ten-dollar piece to take the “mater,” whenever
he should see her. The rest he would
use, of course, but not waste. He would
paint such pictures up here as would make
his old artist friends and the critics open
their eyes. The very novelty of the material
which should embody them would
“take.” Already, in imagination, he saw
dozens of fascinating “bits” hung on the
line at the old Academy, and felt the marvelous
sums they brought swelling his
pockets to bursting. He’d be the rage, the
hit of the next season; and what pride he’d
have in sending newspaper notices of himself
to Peace Island. How Margot would
open her blue eyes, and Angelique toss her
hands, and the master slowly admit that
there was genius where he had estimated
only talent.</p>

<p>“There’s such a wide, wide difference in
the two!” cried Adrian, aloud.</p>

<p>“Hey? What?”</p>

<p>The dreamer came back to reality, and to
Pierre, demanding:</p>

<p>“Make it one-seventy-five, and I’ll do it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I will. Now for to-night. Shall
we camp right here or go further into the
forest. In the woods I’m always ready for
bed, and it’s later than usual now.”</p>

<p>“Here. I know the very rocks you got
under in that storm. They’ll do as good as
a tent, and easier.”</p>

<p>Adrian, also, knew that spot, and in a
few moments both lads were asleep. They
had not stopped even to build the fire that
was customary in such quarters.</p>

<p>Pierre was awake first, on the next morning,
and Adrian slowly rose, stretching his
cramped limbs and yawning widely.</p>

<p>“Well, I must say that Angelique’s good
mattress beats rocks. You don’t catch me
doing that again. I guess I’ll walk down
to the water and have a last look at the
island.”</p>

<p>“I guess you won’t. You’ll eat your
breakfast right now. Then you’ll fix that
birch for the carry. If I do the heavy work
you’ve got to do the light.”</p>

<p>“Sounds fair enough, but you’re paid and
I’m not.”</p>

<p>“It is fair.”</p>

<p>Adrian did not contest the point, the less
readily because he saw that the fried
chicken Angelique had given them was
rapidly diminishing in quantity.</p>

<p>“Think I’ll fall-to myself. My, but I’m
hungry! Wish I had a cup of coffee.”</p>

<p>“Can’t waste time now. We’ll have
some to-night.”</p>

<p>“Did they give us some?”</p>

<p>“Look in the pack.”</p>

<p>“After breakfast I’ll oblige you.”</p>

<p>Pierre grinned and helped himself to a
wing.</p>

<p>Adrian seized the tin basin which held
the fowl and placed it behind himself.
“Enough’s as good as a feast. We shall be
hungry again. See here. What kind of a
bird was this? or birds? all legs and arms,
no bodies. Freaks of nature. Eh? How
many breast portions have you devoured?”</p>

<p>“Three.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Then, travel or no travel, you get
no wage this day. Understand. I’m commander
of this expedition. I see to the
commissariat. I’ll overhaul the pack, and
take account of stock.”</p>

<p>Pierre assisted at the task. Though he
had been impatient to get away from that
locality, still too dangerously near his
mother’s rule, he intended to keep an eye
on everything. Paid or not paid, as Adrian
fared so would he&mdash;only rather better.</p>

<p>“Why, they must have thought we would
be in the woods a long time. They were
certainly generous.”</p>

<p>They had been, but Pierre considered
that they might have been more so.</p>

<p>“This was for both trips. Half is mine.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense. But&mdash;there. We’re not going
to squabble all the time, like children.
And we both know exactly what we have
to depend on. We must fish and shoot&mdash;”</p>

<p>“How’ll you do that? The only gun is
mine.”</p>

<p>“It’s part of the outfit. Let’s see. A
good little tent cloth&mdash;not big enough to
cover any but good-natured folks&mdash;salt
pork, beans, sugar, coffee, tea, flour, meal,
dishes. Hello! We’re kings, Ricord!
Monarchs of Maine.”</p>

<p>“Cut the splints.”</p>

<p>After all, it seemed to be Pierre, who did
the ordering, but Adrian had sense to see
that he was the wiser of the two in woodcraft;
even though he himself had made it
a study during the last weeks. He seized
the axe and attacked a cedar tree, from
which he had soon cut the binding strips
he wanted. Then he laid the paddles in
the boat, fastening them with rootlets to the
three thwarts. He also fastened two broad
bands of the pliable splints in such a way
that when it was inverted the weight of the
canoe could be borne in part by the forehead
and shoulders. He was ready almost
as soon as Pierre had retied the pack, which
was to be Adrian’s burden.</p>

<p>“All right! I’ll swing her up. This
‘carry’ isn’t a long one, and the first thoroughfare
is ten miles before we come to
dead water. But it’s up-stream that far,
and we’ll have to warp up some. Part is
fair, but more is rips.”</p>

<p>If Pierre thought to confound his mate
by his woodland slang he was disappointed.
Margot had been a good teacher, and
Adrian had been eager to learn what he
had not already done from the loggers.
Pierre had been puzzled by “commissariat”
and “expedition,” and felt that he had
evened matters nicely.</p>

<p>“Oh! I know. A thoroughfare is a
river, and a dead water is a lake. And a
carrier is&mdash;yourself!”</p>

<p>To show his new skill he caught up the
canoe and inverted it over his own head.
He, also, had been calculating a bit, and
realized that the birch was really the lighter
burden. So he generously left the pack to
his neighbor and started forward bravely.</p>

<p>“All right, like you say. One little bit,
then you change. Then, too, maybe I’m
not ready.”</p>

<p>With a whistle and spring Pierre hoisted
the pack to his shoulders, wound its straps
around his body, and started off through
the forest at a sort of dog-trot pace, pausing
neither for swamp nor fallen tree, and
Adrian realized that if he were to keep his
companion in sight he must travel equally
fast.</p>

<p>Alas! this was impossible. The birch
which had seemed so light and romantic a
“carry” became suddenly the heaviest and
most difficult. He caught its ends on tree
trunks, and righting these blunders he
stumbled over the rough way. The thongs
that had seemed so smooth cut his forehead
and burned into his chest, and putting pride
in his pocket he shouted:</p>

<p>“Pierre! Pierre Ricord! Come back or
you’ll get no money!”</p>

<p>It would have been a convincing argument
had it been heard, but it was not.
Pierre had already gone too far in advance.
Yet at that moment a sound was borne on
the breeze toward Adrian which effectually
banished all thought of fatigue or of ill-treatment.
A long-drawn, unmistakable
cry that once heard no man with the hunter
instinct ever forgets. The boy’s heart beat
faster.</p>

<p>“A moose! and Pierre has the gun!”</p>

<h3>KINGFISHER’S CREST</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>LL of you know Kingfisher by sight.
But have you ever noticed anything
peculiar about him&mdash;anything different
from the other birds? No? Well, if
you look again you will see that the feathers
on top of his head do not lie smoothly, as is
the case with most birds, but stand almost
on end in the form of a crest. To say the
least, this will seem odd, unless one happens
to know the cause.</p>

<p>Kingfisher was always a rather solitary
fellow. It is said that he came originally
from the South. Whether this is so or not,
we cannot say, but we do know that he
has no relatives in Birdland. He was not
called Kingfisher then; indeed, at that
time he had no name at all. When he first
made his appearance he was in a very unfortunate
plight. No one understood his
language, so that he could get no help
whatever. And, besides, the birds were a
little wary of his big bill. Afterwards, when
more was known of his quiet habits, their
fear turned to something like contempt, and
the newcomer was made the object of no
end of ridicule. They never ceased to
laugh at his great high collar, for it really
looked amiss upon a person having so little
care of his appearance otherwise.</p>

<p>All this he took rather meekly, for the
simple reason that he did not in the least
understand it. In reality, Kingfisher possessed
a quick temper, and had he guessed
that they were making fun of him it would
have gone hard with some of them.</p>

<p>On the second day after his arrival, Kingfisher
was sitting on a dead limb over the
water. He was almost in despair, for as yet
he had had no food, and as he was in a
strange land, he did not know how to get
anything to eat. Suddenly he saw something
move in the water below him. Kingfisher
did not know what it was, but he did
know that it was alive, and, therefore, must
be good to eat. Quick as a flash he dived
for it. The object sank immediately; still,
he followed it. Before he could think he
was well under water, but when he came up
his feathers were dripping and in his bill
was the shining object. Although the fish&mdash;as
he afterwards learned that these creatures
which lived in the water were called&mdash;made
only a mouthful, Kingfisher was more hopeful,
for he now knew how he could make a
living. Soon, indeed, he became such an
expert that folks called him Kingfisher,
meaning, of course, the best fisherman.</p>

<p>When Kingfisher first came to Birdland,
he dug a long, narrow tunnel in the sand
bank near the creek, and at the end of it
he built himself a large room which served
him as a home, for he was afraid to remain
out of doors all night. Of course, this
queer dwelling caused much wonderment,
and, more than that, it suggested to the
birds a way of frightening Kingfisher.
What fun it would be to have him try to
scold them in his broken language!</p>

<p>Accordingly, Song Sparrow, Marsh
Wren, and Blackbird went in a body to
visit Muskrat&mdash;a great, lazy fellow, who
might always be found loafing about the
banks of the stream. What their plan was
no one overheard, for they spoke in very
low tones. At the end of the consultation
Muskrat was seen to climb the bank near
Kingfisher’s dwelling. After a moment or
two, to make sure that Kingfisher was out,
he crept quietly to the entrance and disappeared
within.</p>

<p>Then all the birds along the creek and
from the woods gathered in the neighboring
bushes to await Kingfisher’s arrival. They
had a long wait, for he had gone far in
search of his dinner. But, at length, Catbird
spied the sturdy form wending its way
up stream. Breathless with anticipation,
the birds hid in the undergrowth just as
Kingfisher took his favorite perch in the
dead willow. Here he spent much time
in arranging his plumage, a performance
which greatly aggravated the birds in hiding.
But at last, even this was over, and
everybody in the thicket gave a start of
expectancy as Kingfisher, after a wary look
about, launched himself from the dead limb.
Then, as he entered the hole where, unknown
to him, Muskrat was hiding, each
one held his breath.</p>

<p>But surely the listeners were not prepared
for such a sound as greeted their
ears. With a terrified rattle which no one
had ever heard before, Kingfisher shot out
of the hole and bolted down stream. He
looked neither to the right nor left, nor, indeed,
did he even see the birds on either
side of him. His ears were wide open and
every feather of his head stood on end. To
tell the simple truth, he was frightened out
of his wits.</p>

<p>Many of the birds were sorry for their
prank when they saw how frightened Kingfisher
was, but many also enjoyed it.
Cuckoo, from the willow, kept calling after
Kingfisher, “Coward, coward, coward,
coward!” And, of course, Chewink, as he
hops from limb to limb, with his usual quick
temper wanted to know to whom Cuckoo
referred, and called in a challenging voice,
“To me? to me? to me?”</p>

<p>But Kingfisher was too far away to hear
either of them. Even if he had, he would
not have dared to stop. His fright was so
great that he never got over it. Ever since,
the feathers of his head have remained on
end, and his voice, save for that terrified
rattle, is gone. Listen some day, if you
will, as long as you wish, and you will hear
him make no other sound. Some say&mdash;but,
let us not repeat it unless we are sure&mdash;that
he has never recovered his mind. Certainly,
as we see him sitting on the dead
willow hour after hour, gazing into the
water, he does seem a little peculiar. But,
perhaps, he is only trying to rid himself of
the remembrance of his narrow escape from
that frightful monster which he found occupying
his home.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX<br />
HIRAM</h3>

<h4>SYNOPSIS OF PREVIOUS CHAPTERS.</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Polly Prentiss is an orphan who, for the greater
part of her life, has lived with a distant relative,
Mrs. Manser, the mistress of Manser Farm. Miss
Hetty Pomeroy, a maiden lady of middle age, has,
ever since the death of her favorite niece, been on
the lookout for a little girl whom she might adopt.
She is attracted by Polly’s appearance and quaint
manners, and finally decides to take her home and
keep her for a month’s trial. In the foregoing
chapters, Polly has arrived at her new home, and
the great difference between the way of living at
Pomeroy Oaks and her past life affords her much
food for wonderment.</p>
</div>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="dropcap">P</span>OLLY went down the steps and along
the driveway to the barn. Hiram
was sitting on a long bench just inside
the door, rubbing and polishing some silvery
bells. He looked at Polly with a
broad and hospitable smile.</p>

<p>“It appeared to me ’twas about time we
got acquainted,” he remarked, sociably. “I
had some expectations you might drop in
on me come milking time last night, but I
suppose you had other engagements. Can
you spare time to sit awhile? Your friends
seem to feel to home,” said Hiram, with a
wave of his hand toward Snip and Snap,
who had followed Polly and were racing
up the steep stairs to the hay loft.</p>

<p>“I can stay till Miss Pomeroy wants me,”
said Polly, delightedly, as she slid onto the
end of the bench. “Is there room for me
here, Mr. Hiram?”</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp51" id="i_girl-on-fence" style="max-width: 30em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_girl-on-fence.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">IS THERE ANY ROOM FOR ME HERE?</div>
</div>

<p>“Let’s see,” said Hiram, gravely, taking
a foot rule from his pocket and measuring
the distance between Polly and some bells
lying beside him on the bench. “There’s
most a yard leeway; if you don’t wriggle
more’n twelve inches this way there’ll be
no trouble.”</p>

<p>Hiram closed the rule and put it in his
pocket. As he did this Polly heard a subdued
chuckle. She clasped her arms about
her knees and rocked back and forth on the
fence, laughing gayly.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re some like Uncle Sam
Blodgett!” she cried, as Hiram looked at
her in pretended alarm. “That’s the way
he used to talk to me, all solemn, but with
the fun inside of him. Oh, I like folks
that talk like you and Uncle Blodgett!”</p>

<p>Hiram rose from the bench, and made
a low bow to Polly, the bells jingling in his
hands.</p>

<p>“That’s the first compliment that’s come
my way since I got through my schooling,”
he said, with a twinkle in his blue eyes.
“While I was ’tending school the teachers
would praise me up because I had a good
head for remembering. I could recite
pieces. There was a piece beginning ‘On
Linden when the sun was low,’ that was in
considerable demand. I presume I could
recollect it, if given time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, will you please say it to me, some
time?” pleaded Polly. “I do love to hear
poetry!”</p>

<p>“I’ll teach it to ye, gestures and all,” said
Hiram, much gratified. “There’s a good
deal depends on the gestures, mind.
What’s this now, coming to interrupt?” he
added, as Arctura appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p>“Mis’ Deacon Talcott has come to call,
and Miss Hetty told me to send Mary in,”
said Arctura. “She’s a real pleasant
woman, you won’t mind her.” She
straightened out Polly’s apron bows, and
the little girl walked slowly away, after saying
good-by to her host and promising to
“call again soon.”</p>

<p>“She’s got a pair of honest eyes in her
head as ever I saw, and she’s a real sweet-dispositioned
child,” said Arctura, looking
after Polly, “but I don’t know as I ever saw
one of her age so quiet.”</p>

<p>“She’s been kept with a parcel of old
folks, and we aren’t much better,” said
Hiram, thoughtfully. “Miss Hetty was
telling me she couldn’t seem to find out any
kind of play the child cared about, but I
said to her, give the little thing time; probably
work is what she’s used to, more’n
anything else; let her get used to play gradual,
I say; don’t try to make her give up
her old folks’ ways all at once. She’s ready
for fun, soon as she knows it is fun,” said
Hiram, “I can see that.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Arctura, briskly, “I’ll say
one thing for her, she don’t tell how hard
she’s been worked, or say anything but
what’s pleasant about the Manser Farm
folks. She seems fond of ’em all, and yet
I kind of think she holds back something,
for once in a while she’ll start to tell one
thing or another, and then stop and bite
her lip.”</p>

<p>“I know one thing, sure,” said Hiram,
firmly, as his sister stepped out of the barn,
“that little thing’s no hypocrite, nor no
cheat, or my name’s something beside
Green! Let’s see, how did that piece go?
‘On Linden when the sun was low, all
bloodless lay the untrodden snow.’ Soon
as I get these bells out of my hands,” he
muttered, as he turned back to the bench,
“I’ll just run through that, with the
gestures. I don’t believe there’s a line of
it that’s escaped me, if I am going on a hundred!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>CHAPTER X<br />
A DELIGHTFUL CALLER</h3>
  </div>

<p><span class="dropcap">P</span>OLLY had no trouble on her mind
when Mrs. Talcott left the house after
an hour’s call. She knew from the
visitor’s gentle, sweet face and manner, as
well as from her beautiful black silk gown
that she was another grand person like Miss
Hetty. Polly had often seen Mrs. Talcott
at church in the distance, and had admired
her from the Manser pew, which was in the
gallery back where the shadows gathered.
Polly had once watched a sunbeam dance
on a violet bow in Mrs. Talcott’s bonnet.</p>

<p>“How do you do, my dear?” the visitor
had asked, when Miss Pomeroy presented
“little Mary Prentiss” to her. “I’m sure
I have caught a glimpse of you now and
then at church. I believe you don’t go to
the Number Three school with my children,
do you?”</p>

<p>“I am very well, thank you, ma’am,”
said Polly, sedately, though her dimples
showed. “Yes’m, I have seen you in
church; the sun comes in the gallery window
and dances on your bonnet sometimes,
just as pretty. No, ma’am, I go to Number
Four, where there are just five boys and
nobody else but me. The teacher says it’s
hardly worth while to keep a school for five
sprawling boys that will be farmers when
all’s said and done, and one little girl that’s
nobody,” said Polly, quoting Mrs. Manser
without a touch of injured feeling, “but
we’re out of the other districts, the Higgins
boys and I are, ma’am.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Talcott flushed, and drew the little
girl to her side.</p>

<p>“I’ve brought you a present, Mary,” she
said, putting a box into Polly’s hands.
“My children always like a surprise, and I
knew you wouldn’t be expecting this; it’s
very pure candy,” said Mrs. Talcott, looking
over Polly’s head to Miss Pomeroy for
approval, “it cannot possibly hurt her.”</p>

<p>It seemed too good to be true, but there
were dozens of the delicious chocolate
drops in the box. Polly’s cheeks grew
crimson as she saw them.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Deacon Talcott,” she said, lifting
her shining eyes to this wonderful visitor.
“I expect I don’t know how to thank you
right, but I do wish I did! I’ve had so
many presents now, you could hardly believe.
It began before I left Manser Farm.
I had new clothes, bought right out of the
store, the gingham was, and nobody had
ever worn it before. I wish I had one of
those dresses on, to show you,” said Polly,
who had been advised by Miss Pomeroy
to keep on her red frock under a white
apron for the afternoon.</p>

<p>“Never mind, my dear,” said Miss Pomeroy,
exchanging a quick glance with her
caller. “Mrs. Talcott may see it some other
day.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m,” said Polly, “and then Uncle Sam
Blodgett gave me a knife that will be an
extra fine article if I should get the broken
blade fixed, and some slippery elm, and
Aunty Peebles gave me a dear little pincushion,
and Miss Pomeroy bought me a
bag of gum-drops and chocolates&mdash;but
those are gone all but one, for Miss Arctura
likes them; she has a sweet tooth, though
she doesn’t often indulge it, she says&mdash;and
then Miss Pomeroy bought me these beautiful
shoes that I have on,” she finished,
breathlessly, sticking out one small foot for
inspection. “You see it’s been presents
and presents,” said Polly, beaming upon
Mrs. Talcott and then turning to Miss
Hetty with a face aglow with gratitude.</p>

<p>“So it seems, my dear,” said the visitor,
and when Polly mentioned her plan in regard
to Aunty Peebles, Mrs. Talcott said
cordially, “Why not send her part of these
chocolates, Mary?”</p>

<p>“I hoped and hoped you’d say for me to
do that,” said Polly, earnestly. “If you
please, Miss Pomeroy, I would like to send
them the middle of next week, for it always
seems long then to Aunty Peebles from
Sunday to Sunday. She values her privileges
very much,” said Polly.</p>

<p>“You shall send them next Wednesday
if all goes well,” said Miss Pomeroy, “and
perhaps you’d like to write a letter to go
with them. We’ll see about it. And now
you may run off, Mary, and read or do anything
you like.”</p>

<p>Polly said good-by, and then as she
reached the doorway she turned and made
a courtesy to the guest.</p>

<p>“Will you please pay my respects to your
family,” said Polly, and then she departed,
hugging her precious box.</p>

<p>“I believe I was just about like Eleanor
that time,” she said, as she put her new
treasure away in the top bureau drawer,
“for they both looked as pleased as could
be. Now I’m going to the library to pick
out a book, and take it out on the south
porch. Seems as if probably I could read
better out-doors.”</p>

<p>Miss Pomeroy and her visitor were in the
parlor and the door was closed, so Polly
had no fear of disturbing them. She had
never owned any books except the Bible
and her school reader, but she had heard
a great deal about stories from her friends
at Manser Farm. Uncle Sam Blodgett had
a battered Shakespeare, from which he had
recited extracts, and Polly had looked upon
the book with awe.</p>

<p>“I guess I’d better begin with a small
book,” she said, as she stood for a moment
undecided in the centre of the library,
looking about at the bewildering display of
literature. “Of course, small books are
meant for boys and girls, and I’ll take one
from that shelf under the window; probably
those are the ones Eddy reads. Miss
Pomeroy said yesterday I could choose
anything I liked. Here’s one that won’t
take very long,” said Polly, kneeling to slip
a small, leather-covered volume from its
place.</p>

<p>“‘S-e-s-a-m-e and Lilies;’ that’s a pretty
name,” she said, approvingly. “I don’t
know what sesame means, but probably I
shall when I’ve read far enough. There
aren’t any pictures, but Uncle Sam Blodgett’s
book didn’t have any pictures, either,
except one in the front, of the gentleman
that wrote it. I’ll go out on the porch and
begin right off.”</p>

<p>On the south porch there were two low
wooden chairs, and Polly seated herself in
one of these, resolutely facing away from
the big oaks which waved their branches
so alluringly, and appeared to be inviting
her to play with them and follow their
beckoning down the road.</p>

<p>The book seemed very strange and hard
to understand, but Polly read on bravely
page after page, stopping now and then to
spell a word softly, and shake her curly
head over it. When she had read ten pages
she closed the book with a little sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“If I read it by tens I can remember the
place better,” said Polly, to the oaks, “and
I don’t believe it makes much difference
where I stop, because it goes right on and
on, and there doesn’t seem to be any story
to it. I didn’t suppose there were so many
long words in the world, but Uncle Sam
Blodgett always says ‘understanding comes
with experience,’ and I guess I shall have
a good deal of experience before I finish
this book,” said
Polly, soberly.</p>

<p>She felt a little
bit lonely in spite
of all the good
things that had
been showered
upon her.</p>

<p>“I wish I could
paddle in that
brook down in the
meadow, and I
wish I could see
what’s growing in
the woods,” said
Polly, wistfully. “I
guess I’m not very
much like Eleanor
yet. I don’t suppose
she ever
wanted to go barefoot.”</p>

<p>This was rather
sorrowful, but after
Mrs. Talcott had
gone Miss Pomeroy
and Polly took
a pleasant walk
under the big oaks,
and Miss Pomeroy
smiled, with pleasure,
Polly thought,
when she saw the
book the little girl
had chosen. And after supper there was
a delightful time in the barn while Hiram
milked. Altogether Polly felt modestly contented
when she got into bed that night.
She had composed a short prayer, which
she added to her usual petitions:</p>

<p>“Dear Father in heaven,” prayed little
Polly, “please make me just as much like
Eleanor as You think it’s best for me to be,
for You know all about her. Amen.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>CHAPTER XI<br />
A PLEASANT PLAN</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>ATURDAY was a busy day. Polly
not only helped Arctura in the
kitchen, but together they made the
beds, for Miss
Hetty, who usually
preferred to take
that duty upon
herself, had to go
away unexpectedly
for an hour or so
after breakfast. So
Arctura and Polly
turned the feather-beds
and “plumped
them up,” putting
the mattresses
squarely over them
without any bulging
out of the soft
beds below, then
stretched the sheets
as smooth and
tight as they could
be drawn, and over
them the fleecy
blankets&mdash;Polly’s
were striped with
pink&mdash;and last of
all they put on the
snowy counterpanes
and patted
the stout pillows
till they lay round
and even at the
head of each bed.</p>

<p>Snip and Snap
added their society
in Miss Pomeroy’s room. Suddenly Snip
vanished, and Snap seemed much distressed.
Arctura, who had been struggling
to reduce an unaccountable lump on her
side of the bed, made an exclamation, and
drew out the sheets and blankets, and Snip,
breathless but unvanquished, slid to the
floor.</p>

<p>“My land!” ejaculated Miss Green, surveying
the kitten with apparent disgust.
“If you haven’t got any more sense than
to go where you’ll be made up with a bed,
it don’t seem as if you were worth raising!”
But she took Snip up in her arms and
stroked him, receiving for reward a vigorous
scratch on the nose.</p>

<p>“Well, now, aren’t you the ungratefullest
little piece that ever was?” said Arctura,
setting him hastily down, and tenderly
caressing her injured feature. “Didn’t you
know to-morrow was Sunday and the minister
coming to dinner? You’ve settled one
thing. I shouldn’t be willing to sit down
to a meal, facing him, all battered up this
way. I shall tell Miss Hetty, so she needn’t
consider it for a minute,” said Miss Green
firmly, as she led the way to the kitchen.</p>

<p>There were two squash pies and two
apple pies to be made that morning, and
Polly was allowed to help with the rolling,
and to crimp all the edges of the crust with
a delightful little wheel. Arctura watched
her with the first pie, but after that she
bustled about the kitchen singing a gay little
refrain.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh&mdash;she&mdash;was&mdash;as&mdash;beautiful as a butterfly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And as proud as a queen,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was pretty little Polly Perkins,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of Abingdon Green,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>sang Arctura over and over again, and little
Polly Prentiss listened with delight.</p>

<p>“You have a splendid voice, haven’t you,
Miss Arctura?” she said, when at last the
song stopped as the pies were put in the
oven. “And what pretty words there are
to that tune.”</p>

<p>“My voice isn’t anything now to what
it was,” said Miss Green, evidently much
pleased. “I can’t rely on it as I once could.
When my brother John, that lives out West,
and I were in our teens we used to be called
for far and near, whenever there was music
wanted. He had a good tenor voice, and
I could sing way up above the staff without
straining my tones a mite. But now
I’m getting old and I have to bear just as
light as I can on the high notes, and there’s
a number down towards G on the second
line that are apt to fail me when I’m least
expecting it,” said Arctura, and Polly
thought her voice sounded a little sad.</p>

<p>“I think it’s all beautiful,” said Polly,
with perfect sincerity. “It’s a great deal
better than anybody’s voice in the choir at
the church. I am just sure!”</p>

<p>“They’ve got some young folks in the
singing seats that lack training,” said Arctura,
and then she dismissed that subject.
“You put me in mind of that ‘Polly Perkins’
someway,” she remarked, sitting down
in the big kitchen rocker, and pulling the
little girl into her lap. “To be sure, your
name’s Mary, and, of course, favor’s a deceitful
thing and beauty’s a vain snare, but
someway you brought that song to mind
when you were crimping those pie edges.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I’m much like a queen,
Miss Arctura,” said Polly, greatly pleased,
but a little confused. “I haven’t any
crown, you see, or any trailing dresses, and
I haven’t anything to be proud about. I
expect queens look like this, don’t you?”
and, springing to her feet, Polly tossed
back her head and stood with her chin
raised and her small nose tilted up into the
air, gazing out of the window.</p>

<p>“Mercy me, that’s almost like play acting!”
cried Arctura. “I guess Hiram can
teach you gestures easy enough. I understand
you’re going to commit ‘On Linden.’
Well, it’s a real stirring piece, and it’ll give
you good exercise. Hiram’s all over the
lot, when he says it. He rehearsed it to me
last night, and I said to him he’d got to
bear in mind that little girls weren’t grown
men, and not keep you thrashing round,
stooping down, and reaching up every last
living minute. I pointed out a few places
where he could omit some of his arm work,
and he’s going to do so. I shall expect to
be invited to a performance when you get
it all learned.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” said Polly, gayly, “and
perhaps Miss Pomeroy would come, too.
I know some pieces that Uncle Blodgett
taught me, but they hadn’t any gestures
except a bow at the beginning and one at
the end. And Mr. Hiram must know
other poems, doesn’t he?”</p>

<p>“He’s full of ’em as a nut is of meat,”
laughed Arctura, “both prose pieces and
poetry, and all he wants is opportunity.
Why, I’ve heard him many a time, spouting
away to himself in the barn, but I’ve
never taken any notice, for you give an
inch to these people that recite, and they’ll
take an ell quick enough; it’s just like starting
a leak. But a regular performance,
such as you speak of, with different ones
taking part, I believe Miss Hetty would
enjoy it for once, anyway; she don’t have
much to amuse her.”</p>

<p>“And you would sing?” asked Polly,
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Um-m&mdash;’twould be according to
whether I could depend on my voice. I
could try it with the scales, I expect, late
in the afternoon,” said Arctura, “and then
we could give the entertainment right after
supper, soon as the dishes were cleared up.
Goodness me! look at that clock! It’s most
half-past ten!” and then there was a busy
time in the kitchen until the noon hour
brought dinner and rest.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>CHAPTER XII<br />
SESAME AND LILIES</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>FTER her resting hour on the bed
Polly took her book again from the
low shelf and read another ten pages.
Before Miss Pomeroy went to her room
after dinner, Polly asked for a pencil and
paper, and Miss Hetty gave her a pad of
smooth paper in a pretty linen cover, to
which a sharp pencil was attached by a long
red ribbon.</p>

<p>“Another present!” the little girl exclaimed
when Miss Pomeroy told her she
was to keep the pad “for her very own.”</p>

<p>“Another present,” said the mistress of
the house, smiling down into the brown
eyes, and she kissed Polly as she stood at
the foot of the stairs.</p>

<p>Polly’s head felt warm and tired, and she
longed to run out into the woods with her
book, but with the thought of Eleanor in
her mind, she set her lips firmly and took
her seat on the south porch, and began her
self-appointed task. Polly would have
been spared a good deal of trouble if she
could have overheard what Miss Pomeroy
was saying to Arctura, while the little girl
sat so quietly reading and copying words
from the leather-covered book to the paper
in her lap.</p>

<p>“I don’t know just what to make of little
Mary,” said Miss Pomeroy, looking rather
disturbed. “She is so busy reading and
writing that she didn’t hear me come downstairs,
and she is reading a book by Ruskin
which is suitable for grown people, and I
don’t see how she can possibly understand
it, or enjoy it. Yet there she sits, copying
a few words ‘to look up in the dictionary,’
she told me. Do you suppose most
little girls of ten nowadays would do that?
Of course, you and I haven’t had anything
to do with children for a long time,” said
Miss Pomeroy gravely. “I might ride
over to Maple Hill and ask Mrs. Manser
if Mary had been used to books, but I dislike
the woman, and I should not prefer
to do it.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t bother,” said Arctura, easily.
“Probably she’s kind of forward for her
age, but I guess we can liven her up by degrees.
She’s real fond of a good time, provided
it’s quiet now. You see she eats a
good deal and she don’t exercise much,
and take that with her nap every afternoon
and reading so long, I expect she feels sort
of dull some of the time. She’s a good
deal livelier at her work than I am,”
said Miss Green, handsomely, “and she’s
a sweet little thing if ever there was one in
this world. I’m getting fond of her right
along. Come Monday, how would it be if
I should speak of her going out to play
awhile in the afternoon? She could take
her book along to the woods. I can tell
her of a place. We’ve got to make a start
with her sometime.”</p>

<p>Miss Pomeroy cordially approved this
plan. After a few minutes she went out on
the porch, and soon she and Polly started
for a walk. Miss Pomeroy was a little
troubled with rheumatism, so the walk was
not a brisk one, but Polly stepped soberly
along at her side, and together they talked
of the birds and the flowers. They saw
and heard eight birds that day, and Polly
recounted them to Arctura after supper&mdash;a
robin, a crow, a ground sparrow, a song
sparrow, a blue jay, a phœbe-bird, a red-winged
blackbird, and a thrush.</p>

<p>“Spring is upon us without a doubt,” said
Polly, joyfully quoting Miss Pomeroy.
“And, oh, it’s so pretty along the edges of
the road, Miss Arctura!”</p>

<p>“How’d you like to go off into the woods
with your book, some day?” suggested
Miss Green, and she was mystified by the
look that came into the child’s eyes.</p>

<p>“I’d like to very much, if Miss Pomeroy
thinks best,” said Polly, quietly, but her
heart was dancing.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Miss Pomeroy was looking at
the top sheet of Polly’s pad, laid on the
dictionary, “for I think I will find out about
those words before I read any more,” Polly
had said. This was the list: “Acquirement,
mercenary, punctilious, sagacity, concomitants,
unsullied, devastated, macadamization,
trivial, boulevard, burgher, martello,
vestige, erroneous, consecutive, assigned.”</p>

<p>“You understand all the words you have
read except these?” questioned Miss Pomeroy,
with her keen eyes on Polly’s flushed
face, as the little girl straightened up from
her study of the big dictionary when bedtime
came.</p>

<p>“No, ma’am,” said Polly, honestly, “but
I could guess most of the other long ones,
and I wanted to get on with the book.”
Then suddenly the little girl felt very brave.
“Would&mdash;would Eleanor have known all
those words without the dictionary? all of
them?” she ventured.</p>

<p>“My dear child,” said Miss Pomeroy,
gently&mdash;and she did not look as if she were
at all vexed&mdash;“my dear little Mary, there
are several of those words I myself should
be obliged to look up in the dictionary
before I dared try to tell anyone exactly
what they meant. Now run along to bed,
and get to sleep as fast as ever you can,”
and Miss Pomeroy bent her head and
kissed the bright face upturned to hers.</p>

<p>“That’s twice to-day,” said Polly, hugging
herself as she lay in bed, just before
the Sandman carried her off to Slumber-land.
“That’s twice to-day she kissed me!
I guess I’m getting on pretty well. I believe
I must be!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak cursive" id="JUNE_MEADOWS">JUNE MEADOWS</h2>
</div>

<hr class="r5" />

<p class="h2sub smcap">By Julia McNair Wright</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="dropcap">J</span>UNE is the month of flowers, as May is
of leaves; it is also the month of the
richest and most varied colors. The
leaves are in their prime and their flowers
are in their greatest luxuriance. Green is
the chief color in the plant world. It is so
constantly the color of leaves that “green
as a leaf” and “leaf green” are common
expressions.</p>

<p>Next to green, yellow is the most conspicuous
color. This is the chief color of
stamens and pistils; it is also the chief color
of spring flowers, though white blossoms
also abound. When the warmth and glow
of the sunshine return to us many flowers
seem to assume the livery of the sun; flecks
and streaks of sunshine gleam at us from
hundreds of nooks and corners. The bluebird
and the jay come to us decked in the
clear blue of the sky, but the spring flowers
outbid them a hundred to one in choosing
the “class color” of the season.</p>

<p>The very thought of spring is associated
with dandelions, buttercups, hawksweed,
mustard, cinquefoil, primroses, cowslips,
marsh marigolds, adder’s tongue, and a
hundred other yellow beauties, from the inconspicuous
parsnip and wild radish to the
sunny splendor of the meadow lily and
lady’s slipper.</p>

<p>In Alaska the flowers are nearly all yellow
or white; blue and pink blossoms are
the exceptions.</p>

<p>After yellow, white is the most frequent
color, and we recall a succession of blossoms,
from little white chickweed through
star-flower and trillium, bunch-berry, and
bell-wort, up to the great white fragrant
lilies. Next in order of abundance comes
blue, then pink, purple, red, and, least seen
of all, that rich scarlet that graces the cardinal
flower and salvia.</p>

<p>Although light seems to have such influence
on the production of color in plants,
we find many plants deeply green or
gaudily colored, that grow where there is
little or no light. Sea weeds of intense
green, or painted as gayly as parrots, come
from depths under water where the light
must have been very dim.</p>

<p>The most vivid colors are often found in
the mold in jars of preserves that have been
kept entirely in the dark. This mold is a
vegetable growth.</p>

<p>In the spring one may notice early in the
morning a bed of chickory in bloom; it is a
clear, exquisite blue; by ten o’clock the blue
will be very pale, by twelve the flowers are
white, by one they are all folded up, to open
the next day as richly blue as ever. The
sun plays such tricks on blue cotton cloth.
When it is exposed to the sun the blue vanishes,
and when the cloth has been put away
in the darkness the fled color returns.
Other flowers besides chickory grow pale
with the excess of light, just as some grow
pale from darkness. The study of color in
the plant world affords opportunity for interesting
experiments.</p>

<p>Bryant calls June “flowery June,” Coleridge
calls the month “leafy June”&mdash;it
might also be called fragrant June, for it
seems the natal month of most fragrant
flowers. One may notice sometimes in
Scotland such a rich, almost overwhelming
fragrance on a ripple of wind that one will
stop to consider its origin. The source is
not far to seek; it is a bean field in full
blossom.</p>

<p>Another very common and fragrant family
of June blooming plants is that of the
trefoil, or clover family. A field of common
red clover in full blossom will rival in
richness of perfume the famous Scotch bean
field. The clover field is a blaze of beauty&mdash;full,
round, rosy heads spread under the
sunshine a cloth, not of gold, but of purplish
pink, strong, healthy plants these, full
of suggestions of vigor.</p>

<p>Across this field boom thousands of bumble
bees, and here we are reminded that
the bumble bee is the special partner of the
red clover, carrying its pollen and paid by
the honey from the deep cups. The red
clover is not a native of America. It was
introduced here, as in Australia, from England,
but seems to have taken a special hold
on the hearts of
the people and
upon the soil as
well.</p>

<p>Each head of
red clover is composed
of hundreds
of little
florets, tube-shaped,
each with
its own calyx,
each with its own
nectary, honey-full
and deeply
hidden, each pouring
its portion of
perfume on the
warm June air.</p>

<p>Another clover
becoming naturalized,
a stranger
from afar, is the
crimson or Hungarian
clover.
The head of the
blossoms is not
round, but long,
shaped like the
first joint of a
forefinger. The
color is rich, vivid crimson or blood-red.
This is the clover so provided with tough
hairs that it has proved injurious to
cattle.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp57" id="i_summer-noon" style="max-width: 30em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_summer-noon.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">SUMMER NOON</div>
</div>

<p>An entire contrast to the large and showy
Hungarian clover is the modest, low-growing,
dainty, white clover, its fragrance
equally delicious, but more subtle and delicate.
The white clover has a short, simple
stem, its leaves are much smaller than those
of the red clover, and the plant hugs the
ground, having a running habit. It is such
a close grower that where it once possesses
the soil it is capable of crowding out the
most noxious weeds, even the much-detested
plantain. Among these white clover
will be found heads of a larger growth,
more rounded and of a pure flesh tint. The
head of white clover is somewhat flattened,
is loose, and has a greenish tint under its
whiteness, because the little green calyx of
each tube is seen.</p>

<p>Leaving the
meadows and the
clover bloom and
entering some
long undisturbed
wood lot, or passing
near the thick
undergrowth beside
some little
brook, a rich, special
fragrance
greets us, more
delicious than any
spicy waft from
Araby the blest.
It is lavishly
poured upon the
air by the inconspicuous
green
blossoms of the
wild grape; once
we meet a
breeze heavily
laden with this
exquisite odor it
is never forgotten,
and the sensitive
nostril is likely to
try all other perfumes
by that one unattainable standard.</p>

<p>The month of June marshals in the
choicest of the fragrant bands&mdash;the rose.
The lilies also are June flowers; the golden
lily, the stately white lily, each one pouring
from its chalice a wealth of sweetness, each
one fair enough to be the long-sought Holy
Grail. These, together with the honeysuckle
tribe, well substantiate the claim of
June as the especial month of fragrance.</p>

  </h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NE of the best tendencies of the summer
is to bring us into closer touch
with nature. When the lawns and
fields are grass-covered and the trees green
overhead, we are drawn from our artificial
winter life to earth and nature. We have
been associated with the earth through too
many centuries to deny its hold upon us
now. This indoor life is a comparatively
recent fad. As yet we have not forgotten
that we are creatures of the dust.</p>

<p>In the old Greek mythology there was
a character, Antæus by name, of whom it
was said that his strength increased tenfold
every time he touched the soil. To be conquered
he must be lifted from the earth.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is applicable to us all. Are
we not stronger for our contact with nature?
Are we not better able to meet the
modern Hercules when he comes to us in
the guise of ill health? Certainly we would
be but poor creatures were it not for the
woods, fields, and mountains.</p>

<p>Aside from the matter of health, it would
be difficult to say in just what way nature
helps us. Without effort on our part we
can get nothing from her. To learn her
secrets we must already be armed with
knowledge, or, if not this, then with the
keenest of vision and hearing. Perhaps,
most of all, the benefit lies merely in our
contact with the out-of-door world, just as
there is in any uplifting companionship. Is
there not something inspiring to us all in
the mountain’s grandeur, the hemlock’s
silent depths, or the green vista of rolling
meadows? In any event, we are the better
for being in touch with nature. Let us all,
therefore, strive to be naturalists.</p>

<p>By this we do not mean for boys and girls
to learn the classification of birds and
plants. In the broad sense the naturalist
is one who enjoys the out-of-door world.
Then, surely, some one will say, we are all
naturalists, for who does not take delight
in nature? We grant this, but, on the other
hand, how many of us get the full measure?
It is just as reasonable to expect a young
person to get the utmost enjoyment amid
a party of strangers as to believe that the
uninitiated boy or girl will derive the full
pleasure from a walk in the woods. In the
unlearned, what interest is awakened by the
little pink flower half buried by last year’s
leaves, or the unknown bird-note which
comes from the leafy maze overhead? They
are but as the casual voice of the stranger
whom we pass unheeded in the city street.
But learn to know and welcome them as
friends, and each tiny flower and cheery
bird-note will bring with it a charm that
deepens with every return.</p>

<p>On our part two things are needful.
First, we must cultivate our powers of observation,
that we may see and hear and
know the beauties of the animate world
about us. Next, that we look upon each
bird and butterfly and flower as a friend
bringing to us direct from nature that
simple joy and inspiration which is always
new and&mdash;to those who live in the city&mdash;always
necessary.</p>

<h3>The West Indian Calamity</h3>

<p>A catastrophe which has not been equaled
within recent times, and which can certainly be
compared with the greatest in history, occurred
on May 8 on the Island of Martinique, one of
the French West Indies. By a volcanic eruption
of Mont Pelee, the entire town and population
of St. Pierre, which, according to recent estimates,
reached 40,000, were destroyed in the
space of a few moments.</p>

<p>For three weeks previous, the crater of the
volcano had been pouring forth clouds of black
smoke, but up to May 5 no serious outbreak was
even suggested. At that time an eruption of
mud took place, the hot ashes of the interior
having mingled with the water in the crater.
Three days later, while the population was debating
the question of its danger, the volcano
suddenly burst forth in a torrent of molten rock,
ashes, and flame. Before the unfortunate people
could escape, they and the whole town were
buried by the seething overflow.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, and almost before the
world could comprehend the calamity at St.
Pierre, the volcano La Soufriere, on the neighboring
island of St. Vincent, broke forth, causing
the death of nearly two thousand people.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <img class="center" src="images/eac.jpg" alt="decoration" />
    </div>

<p>In the face of this great calamity, it is touching
to note the prompt and generous response of
the neighboring nations to the cry for help from
the survivors of a hitherto almost unknown
people.</p>

<h3>The Trial of Airships</h3>

<p>One of the most progressive features of the
St. Louis Exposition will be the proposed trial
of air ships, in which the winner will receive a
prize of one hundred thousand dollars in gold.
The event will take place immediately above the
ground of the Washington University, where,
under the direction of a committee of aerial
experts, a figure eight-shaped course will be
marked out by means of anchored balloons.
The length of the course is to be ten miles. The
winner will be the one whose air ship, in a series
of trials, covers the required distance in the
shortest average time.</p>

<p>There will also be twelve other prizes, amounting
to fifty thousand dollars in all, for the performance
of some special accomplishment upon
the part of the contestant.</p>

<p>Mr. Santos Dumont, to whom we look to take
a leading part in the event, states that at least
one hundred and fifty air ships will be entered.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <img class="center" src="images/eac.jpg" alt="decoration" />
    </div>

<p>Such liberal inducements as these should do
much to develop the science of aerial navigation.</p>

<h3>The Labor Strike</h3>

<p>The greatest movement of its kind in history
is the strike which has been declared during the
past month by the anthracite coal miners of
Pennsylvania. Its purposes, among others, are
to obtain an increase in wages and to limit the
working day to eight hours. If, as now seems
possible, the bituminous coal miners shall join
in the movement, not less than 450,000 men
will be directly involved. Besides these, such
a vast number of women and children and other
dependents would be affected by the strike that
its supporters might easily reach into the
millions.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <img class="center" src="images/eac.jpg" alt="decoration" />
    </div>

<p>As coal may fairly be denominated as the food
of all manufacturing industries, this sudden and
severe restriction would threaten something very
like business starvation.</p>

<h3>The Panama Treaty</h3>

<p>By means of a treaty signed by Secretary Hay
and the Colombian Minister, the United States
has secured a perpetual lease, running in hundred-year
periods, of the strip of land through
which the Panama Canal extends. Although
the price of rental is not yet agreed upon, the
United States of Colombia has received seven
million dollars, in consideration of which it will
forego all revenues and sources of income connected
with the land for a period of fourteen
years. In the meantime the terms will be decided.
Should the price of rental remain unsettled
at the end of that time, the question will
be left to a committee of five arbitrators.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <img class="center" src="images/eac.jpg" alt="decoration" />
    </div>

<p>Now that seemingly the last legal obstacle
has been overcome, we can reasonably anticipate
the completion of the Panama Canal.</p>

<h3>A Moving Sidewalk</h3>

<p>To remedy the congested traffic of the Brooklyn
Bridge, it was recently proposed to construct
a movable sidewalk extending along its whole
length. This will resemble very much the
moving boardwalk at the Chicago World’s Fair,
and, like it, will be provided with seats. To
protect the passengers, the entire length will be
covered by a glass shelter. The sidewalk itself
will move at a rate of ten miles an hour.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <img class="center" src="images/eac.jpg" alt="decoration" />
    </div>

<p>Such a contrivance, if successful, will prove
a great boon to those who pass daily between
New York and Brooklyn. It might be well,
however, not to experiment with such an important
thoroughfare as the Brooklyn Bridge,
at least until the new East River structure is
completed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Penetrating Coin.</span>&mdash;This coin
trick may be performed anywhere, and requires
no special preparation. A borrowed
Derby hat is placed upon the mouth of a
tumbler (Fig. 8). Three half-dollars are
now borrowed and tossed into the hat,
whereupon one of the coins is seen to penetrate
the crown of the hat, and drop visibly
and audibly into the tumbler beneath. It
is thus explained:
In the act of placing
the hat on the
glass, secretly and
without jingling
slip a coin of your
own between the
rim of the glass
and the hat. The
weight of the
latter will retain
the coin in its
position, which, of
course, is on the
side of the hat
farthest from the
spectators. The
dropping of the borrowed coins in the hat
will disturb the balance of the secret half-dollar,
causing it to fall into the tumbler.
It is hardly necessary to remind the student
that the fourth coin must be gotten rid of
unbeknown to the audience, otherwise the
effect is destroyed. In putting the hat in
position two hands may be used. This will
greatly facilitate the placing of the coin on
the rim of the tumbler. You should lay
stress on the fact that it is necessary to get
the hat evenly on the glass. As simple as
this trick seems in explanation, it is nevertheless
wonderfully illusive, and can be
especially recommended to the amateur.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp51" id="i_fig8" style="max-width: 18.0625em;">

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 8</span></div>
</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An excellent trick, to be used in conjunction
with the preceding, is the following:
The performer shows a coin and
forthwith proceeds to pass it into the hat
by way of the crown. That there may be
no doubt as to the actual passing of the
coin, it is left sticking halfway through the
hat; a final push and it is heard to fall inside.
The coin used is a
trick one, constructed as follows:
A groove is first
turned round its extreme
edge deep enough to conceal
a small India-rubber band.
It is next cut in half across
its diameter. A hole is
drilled in the centre of one
half, in which is inserted a needle point. In
the other half a slot is cut to admit the
needle. The two halves are now placed together
and kept in position by passing the
band round the groove afore mentioned
(Fig. 9). While giving the final push it
is, of course, withdrawn and palmed.</p>

<h3><em>SUBSCRIBERS FROM AUSTRALIA</em></h3>

<p>Our circle of readers continues to widen rapidly. Quite recently a
number of subscriptions have been received from far off Australia. Even
though in its infancy, <span class="smcap">Youth</span> will soon traverse the entire globe.</p>

<h3><em>ARE YOU PLEASED OR DISPLEASED?</em></h3>

<p>We are not seeking fulsome praise, but we would like to hear
directly from our readers whether or not <span class="smcap">Youth</span> is coming up to their
expectations. If it is not, we hope they will feel perfectly free to
tell us about its shortcomings. Criticisms and suggestions are invited
from all readers. We should be glad to publish in an early issue, if
agreeable to the reader, the letter of the person who sends in the most
practical suggestion.</p>

<h3><em>FIFTY CENTS FOR TWENTY-FIVE NAMES</em></h3>

<p>Anyone who will send us the names and addresses of twenty-five of his
friends, boys or girls, and fifty cents additional, will receive a
year’s subscription to <span class="smcap">Youth</span>. The magazine will be sent to any desired
address. This is a very easy way for any person, young or old, to
obtain a year’s subscription. We wish the twenty-five names for the
sole purpose of distributing sample copies of <span class="smcap">Youth</span>. They will be put
to no other use, so that no one need have any hesitation in sending the
list.</p>

<h3><em>BACK NUMBERS TO SUBSCRIBERS</em></h3>

<p>All persons who contemplate subscribing to <span class="smcap">Youth</span> are urged to forward
their names as soon as possible. While we are daily in receipt of
many subscriptions, and have been since the first announcement of the
magazine, yet we desire to increase our list to even a greater number.</p>

<p>Those persons who have not yet subscribed will, for the time being,
receive all of the back numbers beginning with the first issue. This
will enable them to obtain several extra copies without cost, and at
the same time give them the opportunity of having all of the continued
stories complete.</p>

<h3><em>$100 PRIZE STORY</em></h3>

<p>In order to encourage our readers to literary effort, we have decided
to offer a cash prize of $100 for the best short story for young
people, from one to five thousand words in length, suitable for
publication in this magazine. Full particulars in regard to this offer
will be found in the advertising pages of this issue. The offer is
confined exclusively to subscribers of <span class="smcap">Youth</span>, and we hope to see a
large number of stories entered from them for competition.</p>

<h3><em>AN EASY WAY TO EARN MONEY</em></h3>

<p>In order to increase the circulation of <span class="smcap">Youth</span> as rapidly as possible,
we have decided to make some exceptional inducements to boys and girls
to obtain subscriptions. The work can be done after school hours,
and on Saturdays and holidays. The arrangement we make for doing the
canvassing renders the work very agreeable, and the commission offered
is so large that it cannot fail to be an inducement.</p>

<p>To such of our readers as would like to earn a considerable sum of
money with little effort, we suggest that they send us their names and
addresses, and we will at once forward full particulars.</p>

<h3><em>MANUSCRIPTS</em></h3>

<p>The publishers of <span class="smcap">Youth</span> will be glad to examine manuscripts submitted
for publication. They should, if possible, be typewritten, with the
name and address of the writer appearing on the first page. Stamps
should be enclosed for their return if unavailable. Prompt attention
will be given to all manuscripts, and such as are found available
will be paid for upon acceptance, not upon publication. While all
manuscripts will be examined impartially, we shall, of course, be
disposed to consider with greater favor those submitted by our
subscribers, as we wish to encourage them as much as possible to
contribute to our columns.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
